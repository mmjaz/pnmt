not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor,
as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no brass' and no house.
While I picked the fruit, and she made the paste for the pies,
she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress,
and the childer, as she called the young people.
she affirmed:
aboon two hundred year old for all it looked but a small, humble place,
th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys,
as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry.
Still, she allowed:
the owd maister was like other folk;
naught mich out o' t' common way:
stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like.
they had told her their father,
had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted,
turning bankrupt;
as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes,
they must provide for themselves.
Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed ,
the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down;
Mary's countenance was equally intelligent,
her features equally pretty;
but her expression was more reserved,
and her manners, though gentle, more distant.
not one modern piece of furniture,
save a brace of w orkboxes and a lady's desk in rosewood,
which stood on a side table:
everything including the carpet and curtains looked at once,
well worn and well saved.
Mr. St. John sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused,
and his lips mutely sealed
was easy enough to examine.
Yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of,
a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature.
Quiescent as he now sat,
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow,
which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager.
Diana, as she passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea,
brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.
There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now,
which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.
It is my way it always was my way,
by instinct ever to meet the brief with brevity,
the direct with plainness.
No, he said coolly:
when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends,
we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.
He seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's thoughts,
than as agents to reveal his own:
the which combination of keenness and reserve
was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.
Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage;
but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze,
till the trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.
I need it, and I seek it so far, sir,
that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do,
it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves,
and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind my own security, moral and physical,
to secure these,
I had to leave behind me everything,
I possessed except a small parcel;
which, in my hurry and trouble of mind,
I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross.
it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp,
that you, Mr. Rivers,
forbade me to perish of want at your door,
and took me under the shelter of your roof.
I know all your sisters have done for me since,
for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor,
and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.
Don't make her talk any more now, St. John, said Diana, as I paused;
she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.
as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.
Right, said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.
If such is your spirit, I promise to aid you,
in my own time and way.
I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure,
with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs;
all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds;
its garden, dark with yew and holly,
and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom.
They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling,
to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle path leading from their gate descended,
and which wound between fern banks first,
and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,
or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy faced lambs:they clung to this scene,
I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment.
my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep,
on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
by heath bell, by flower sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag.
The strong blast and the soft breeze,
the rough and the halcyon day;
the hours of sunrise and sunset;
the moonlight and the clouded night,
developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them
the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone,
I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet,
to rest my head on her knee,
and listen alternately to her and Mary,
I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her,
that of scholar pleased and suited me no less.
Our natures dovetailed,
mutual affection of the strongest kind was the result.
Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together,
then she would take lessons;
and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he would,
when his hours of morning study were over,
take his hat, and, foll owed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out
on his mission of love or duty I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful,
And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks,
what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to myself?
Zealous in his ministerial la bours, blameless in his life and habits,
he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist.
He expressed once, and but once in my hearing,
a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills,
and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home;
never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence,
never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.
I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton.
an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines election, predestination, reprobation were frequent;
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness;
it seemed to me that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment
where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations.
I was sure St. John Rivers pure lived,
conscientious, zealous as he was
had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it,
I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium
regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring,
but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them,
as governesses in a large, fashionable, south of England city,
where each held a situation in families
by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependants,
and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences,
and appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting woman.
One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour,
I ventured to approach the window recess
which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study
a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his face,
conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.
Before I explain, recall,
if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,
it must be as the blind man would help the lame.
I find that,
when I have paid my father's debts,
all the patrimony remaining to me will be
this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind,
and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew trees and holly bushes in front.
Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem,
himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders,
and when the Head of that church militant of
whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, Rise, follow Me!'
St. John said these words as he pronounced his
with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance.
I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him
the scantier the meed his toil brings the higher the honour.
indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my face,
as if its features and lines were characters on a page.
her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish
Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle factory and iron foundry in the valley.
The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse,
on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation
of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.
he seemed half to expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer:
not knowing all my thoughts and feelings,
though guessing some,
he could not tell in what light the lot would appear to me.
the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron:
it was not ignoble not unworthy not mentally degrading,
I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude,
and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
I, who preached contentment with a humble lot,
and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service
He will sacrifice all to his long framed resolves, she said: natural affection and feelings more potent still.
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage,
that letter informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,
with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John,
Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings.
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.
In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
and so the old grange was abandoned.
containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard,
with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea things in delf.
with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small,
yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe:
Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable,
as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn,
yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.
let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings;
I know them to be wrong that is a great step gained;
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law,
and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.
For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see;
for the desperate grief and fatal fury consequences of my departure which might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither.
I say lonely, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage,
half hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich
Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.
when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get
when our will strains after a path we may not follow
we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair:
we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind,
as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste
and perhaps purer;
to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us,
if rougher than it.
I burnt for the more active life of the world
for the more exciting toils of a literary career,
for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest:
yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.
my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings,
and mount beyond ken.
God had an errand for me; to bear which afar , to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness which time only can heal.
Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents,
as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head,
he stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised him,
his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the west.
when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head,
and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.
as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded;
as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.
the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray;
the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed;
the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin;
the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses all advantages,
in short, which,combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.
Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
and, forgetting her usual stinted stepmother dole of gifts,
had endowed this, her darling, with a grand dame's bounty.
He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri,
and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.
A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,
he said, as he crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
Do you think you shall like Morton?
she asked of me, with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child like.
Flushed and kindled thus,
he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman.
once subsided, I found some of these heavy looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp witted girls enough.
discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness,
and innate self respect, as well as of excellent capacity,
that won both my goodwill and my admiration.
These soon took a pleasure in doing their work well,
in keeping their persons neat,
in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners.
There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness,
and in repaying it by a consideration a scrupulous regard to their feelings,
to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed,
and which both charmed and benefited them;
To live amidst general regard,
though it be but the regard of working people, is like sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;
serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.
in the midst of this calm, this useful existence after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone,
I used to rush into strange dreams at night:
dreams many coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy,
dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance,
I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis;
then the sense of being in his arms,
hearing his voice,
meeting his eye,
touching his hand and cheek,
loving him, being loved by him
By nine o'clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.
She would canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
Anything more exquisite than her appearance,
in her purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek,
and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined:
when he was looking quite away from the door,
if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble seeming features,
though they refused to relax, changed indescribably,
In spite of his Christian stoicism,
when she went up and addressed him,
and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face,
she would withdraw her hand hastily from his,
and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr like.
St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him;
he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish,
for the elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.
I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,
despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught,
a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.
She said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, she allowed, not one tenth so handsome,
though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.
One evening, while, with her usual child like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the table drawer of my little kitchen,
she discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary,and then my drawing materials and some sketches,
including a pencil head of a pretty little cherub like girl, one of my scholars,
and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.
he expressed in strong terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school,
and said he only feared,
from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,
and would soon quit it for one more suitable.
I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay:
No; they not only live,
but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell,
the hell of your own meanness.
With all his firmness and self control, thought I,
he tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within expresses, confesses, imparts nothing.
to reward you for the accurate guess,
I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture,
provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.
It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver's large fortune,
he might do as much good with it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a tropical sun.
I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproachable,
to hear it thus freely handled,
was beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure an unhoped for relief.
where is the use of going on, I asked,
when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction,
or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart?
human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind ,
and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared
so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self denying plans. And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood,
the young germs swamped delicious poison cankering them:
It is strange, pursued he,
that while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly with all the intensity,
indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating,
I experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me;
I should discover this within a year after marriage;
and that to twelve months' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.
This I know.
While something in me, he went on, is acutely sensible to her charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to co operate in nothing I undertook.
My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance,
of substituting peace for war freedom for bondage religion for superstition the hope of heaven for the fear of hell?
Must I relinquish that?
I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
When I colour, and when I shade before Miss Oliver,
I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness.
I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul.
That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea.
You have taken my confidence by storm, he continued, and now it is much at your service.
I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent;
because these are the means by which men achieve great ends,
and mount to lofty eminence.
I watch your career with interest,
because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman,
not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer.
a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress;for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.
replacing the paper, I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the marginIt . disappeared in his glove;
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.
I pondered the mystery a minute or two;
but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.
Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.
where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate;
It aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me. Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire, he said.
Half an hour ago, he pursued, I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in shire.
whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told;
but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone no one could tell when, where, or how.
what opiate for his severe sufferings what object for his strong passions had he sought there?
the pocket book was again deliberately produced,
opened, sought through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper,hastily torn off:
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred.
indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
Well, then, he said, I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.
I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name it stood.
I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon me that embodied itself,
that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight, every ring was perfect, the connection complete.
A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out.
The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground,
and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen,
I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
were my near kinswomen;
Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each,
justice enough and to spare:
I have been too abrupt in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.
You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds,
the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?
Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year,
I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse,
that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends.
You think so now, rejoined St. John, because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth:
you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you;
of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you:
But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate:
you may marry.
My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved,
as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really,
and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property,
must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place,
they would have done precisely what I wished to do,
they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
now numbering sixty girls, file out before me,
and locked the door,
I stood with the key in my hand,
exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half dozen of my best scholars:
since those days I have seen paysannes and Buerinnen;
and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.
my next to rub it up with bees wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again;
lastly,
the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah,
and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince pies,
and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
seriously,
I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.
To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping;
and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account.
she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsyturvy,
how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.
my cousins having given me carte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased,
and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.
The ordinary sitting room and bedrooms I left much as they were,
for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds,
than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations.
Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,
new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end:
A spare parlour and bedroomrefurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery:
When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within,
as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.
when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs,
he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time:
Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association,
he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth.
St. John was a good man,
but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
at his fine lineaments fixed in study,
I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband,
that it would be a trying thing to be his wife.
It is in scenes of strife and danger,
where courage is proved,
and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked,
that he will speak and move, the leader and superior.
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross,
and chilled with the frosty night air;
Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver,
this done, both followed me.
My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment,
that their fluency covered St. John's taciturnity,
he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.
The event of the day that is,
the return of Diana and Mary pleased him,
but the accompaniments of that event,
the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him:
their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes,
asked him, If his plans were yet unchanged.
where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case,
where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary:
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him:
he seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more,
I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded.
he continually made little chilling differences between us,
which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality,
When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his confidence,
I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised,
when he raised his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping,
and said: You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.
but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish looking grammar,
and wandering over, sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow students, with a curious intensity of observation,
if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn;
I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school;
still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain,
or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go,
he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.
that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements,
and so fix them thoroughly in his mind;
I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,
because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity at least in me was distasteful to him.
I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable,
that in his presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain:
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him,
bidding him good night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom,
and as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand.
He never omitted the ceremony afterwards,
and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern,
to give to my changeable green eyes the sea blue tint and solemn lustre of his own.
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad,
His idea was still with me,
because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse,
nor a sand traced effigy storms could wash away;
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about,
the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present residence and state of health;
I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further,
my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment.
now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters,
and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste,
he sat calm and patient, leaning on his desk,
and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected ,
and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning,
I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it.
I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt.
as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions;
swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun,
and sapphire tints from the firmament.
As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green,
minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star like yellow blossom.
I shall see it again, he said aloud, in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges,
and again in a more remote hour when another slumber overcomes me on the shore of a darker stream!
It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist ,
under the same banner, to join in the same enterprise.
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me,
I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.
It was as if I had heard a summons from Heaven as if a visionary messenger,
like him of Macedonia, had enounced, Come over and help us!
while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task,
He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.
I am sensible of no light kindling no life quickening no voice counselling or cheering.
Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths,
the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!
In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas,
In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice,
I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.
In the tractability with which, at my wish,
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me;
in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it,
in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.
My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse,
condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping hand.
I demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.
Very willingly, he rejoined;
rising, he strode a little distance up the pass,
threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day,
as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.
By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache,
I shall satisfy himto the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.
It is that he asks me to be his wife,
and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge.
Can I receive from him the bridal ring,
endure all the forms of love which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe ,
and know that the spirit was quite absent?
But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage,
or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan.
still my sense, such as it was,
directed me only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should:
I said so. St. John, I returned,
I regard you as a brother you, me as a sister,
so let us continue.
Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims,
merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect with power the mission of your great Master.
that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.
For them he has no use: I retain them.
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence,
and in the feeling that accompanied it.
How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell,
but revelations were being made in this conference: I understood that,
sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.
The veil fell from his hardness and despotism. His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to me! it seemed to say.
You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage:
the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies,
and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices,
all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination
I would cross oceans with him in that capacity;
toil under Eastern suns , in Asian deserts with him in that office;
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight,
nor his measured warrior march trample down.
to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital,
this would be unendurable.
Whether he was incensed or surprised,
or what, it was not easy to tell,
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance,
a topic we should never discuss:
the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise:
it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity,
and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
during that time he made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern,
a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him.
Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear,
and their echo toned every answer he gave me.
in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed,
and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval,
which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner.
I felt how if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source,
could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood,
or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.
and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent,
they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.
as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned,
he added the force of contrast;
remembering, as I looked at him, that this man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations,
as he stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.
St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.
Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire,
I should immediately have left him,
but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could.
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions?
While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace of my former offence,
I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
Most bitterly he smiled most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?
said he, after a considerable pause. I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.
if you are sincere in your offer,
I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor.
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England,
I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.
there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt,
and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed.
Think of the task you undertook one of incessant fatigue , where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.
I must indeed, I said; for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon,
then, I continued, though I have only sisterly affection for him now, yet,
if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation.
I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme,
the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.
He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late,
been his ordinary manner one scrupulously polite.
No doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him,
and now believed he had forgiven me once more.
promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying,
nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.
especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them,
his eye had turned on me.
was slowly, distinctly read, the fearful, the unbelieving, &amp;c. , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone,
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.
I think, with a whispered hint from him,
I tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.
I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim,
to do all things to the glory of God.
Remember, we are bid to work while it is day,
warned that the night cometh when no man shall work.
his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress,
but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep,
or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible.
All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots provided only they be sincere have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.
Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now,
I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion.
I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook,
but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought,
that they had believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often said so;
Having once explained to them that I could not now be explicit about my plans,
they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued them,
soon after four I stood at the foot of the sign post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield.
It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless!
I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon,
and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn,
situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North Midland moors of Morton!
met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know,
and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him is there?
the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield:
ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
How fast I walked!
Another field crossed a lane threaded and there were the courtyard walls the back offices: the house itself,
My first view of it shall be in front, I determined, where its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once where I can single out my master's very window:
I rave: perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.
opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls.
I advanced my head with precaution,
desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front all from this sheltered station were at my command. I wonder what they thought.
They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.
A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow;
and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.
How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it wildly!
He thus grasps and cries, and gazes,
because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter by any movement he can make.
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin.
No need to cower behind a gate post, indeed!
to peep up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!
The front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well like wall,
very high and very fragile looking, perforated with paneless windows,
no roof, no battlements, no chimneys all had crashed in.
No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.
Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements;
for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.
My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates,
and I asked, Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?
I had some questions to ask him.
But when he complied, I scarcely knew how to begin;
such horror had I of the possible answers.
Since he was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.
You are not perhaps aware, he continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, that there was a lady a
Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty;
and you see, when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were bewitched.
Well, he would marry her.
an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy,
but for one fault a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons,
she kept a private bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over much.
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,
the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her pocket,
let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.
for all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the world,
he never could hear a word of her;
He would not cross the door stones of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds,
and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman
than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.
he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself,
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret,
and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my part.
As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash all fell.
if your post boy can drive me to Ferndean before dark this day,
I'll pay both you and him twice the hire you usually demand.
The manor house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate size,
and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.
Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished,
with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.
Even when within a very short distance of the manor house,
you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.
There was a grass grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.
I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling;
but it stretched on and on, it would far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him to examine him, myself unseen, and alas!
A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock,
and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it.
I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield,
and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester.
my life dark, lonely, hopeless my soul athirst and forbidden to drink
my heart famished and never to be fed.
If you won't let me live with you,
I can build a house of my own close up to your door, and you may come,
and sit in my parlour when you want company of an evening.
But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt,
friends who will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?
I find you lonely: I will be your companion to read to you, to walk with you,
to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you.
Perhaps I had too rashly over leaped conventionalities,
and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.
an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.
But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly;
No I have touched you, heard you, felt the comfort of your presence the sweetness of your consolation,
I cannot give up these joys.
You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair,
to wait on me as a kind little nurse for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity ,
and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.
I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and took fresh courage,
these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay,
and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment.
It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you, said I, parting his thick and long uncut locks,
for I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort.
On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails, he said, drawing the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.
It is a mere stump a ghastly sight!
After supper, he began to ask me many questions,
of where I had been, what I had been doing, how I had found him out;
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed ideas, was,
I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this frame of mind.
I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched,
and that I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as ever.
beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me passing like a shadow,
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?
I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy,
If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head,
and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality.
By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then,
I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.
There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.
Now I'll leave you: I have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.
nor did I refuse to let him, when seated, place me on his knee.
Why should I, when both he and I were happier near than apart?
Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield,
and when I could nowhere find you,
and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money,
nor anything which could serve as an equivalent!
A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket,
your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.
I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and starvation,
because to have told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain,
But if you wish me to love you,
could you but see how much I do love you, you would be proud and content.
All my heart is yours, sir:
Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow,
and as they grow they will lean towards you,
and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop.
Hitherto I have hated to be helped to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more.
I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.
Some days since: nay, I can number them four; it was last Monday night,
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy sorrow, sullenness.
I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead.
Late that night perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock ere I retired to my dreary rest,
I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.
some superstition I have in my blood, and always had,
nevertheless, this is true true at least it is that I heard what I now relate.
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine;
for those were your accents as certain as I live they were yours!
Reader, it was on Monday night near midnight that I too had received the mysterious summons,
those were the very words by which I replied to it.
If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind,
yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural.
You cannot now wonder, continued my master, that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night,
I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision,
something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow,
and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion.
The housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people,
to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation,
and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment.
the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air;
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the polishing process:
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.
She had better not wait till then, Jane, said Mr. Rochester, when I read her letter to him; if she does, she will be too late
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the letter in which I communicated it:
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the school where he had placed her.
So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system,
and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes.
By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married life,
and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
never did I weary of gazing for his behalf,
and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam of the landscape before us; of the weather round us,
and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race,
he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.
His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says:
Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.
His is the ambition of the high master spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth,
who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb,
who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
I know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the good,
and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord.
And why weep for this?
;I'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want,

he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike.
but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four penny piece,
How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you.
And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly four penny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.
and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea songs, minding nobody;
sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing.
Dreadful stories they were about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas,
and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main.
for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted,
I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches.
observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright,
black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk,

But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg,
just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night,
I had thought it to be the blind man's trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault,
He was a tall man, over six feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough and ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels.
such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice.
when this story begins only the cupolas of a dozen old villas rotted like water lilies among the massed pines between Gausse's Hotel des trangers and Cannes, five miles away.
In the early morning the distant image of Cannes,
the pink and cream of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy, were cast across the water
Yet one remembered them afterward the young forehead with its furrows of fretful and unprofitable pain.

Amiens was an echoing purple town, still sad with the war, as some railroad stations were: the Gare du Nord and Waterloo station in London.
Then, leaving infinitesimal sections of Wurtemburgers, Prussian Guards, Chasseurs Alpins,

but Mrs. Speers was so sure of Rosemary's beauty and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was willing to gamble the money on ;advantages;;
Then holding her in the hollow of his arm he rubbed his cheek against her cheek's softness, and then looked down at her for another long moment.
and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world.
She assumed that they were dull and stereotyped people, and drunken people, or tiresome, insistent people, or any of the sorts of people that the Divers avoided.
and after a series of semi military turns, shifts, and marches she found herself presumably talking to a neat, slick girl with a lovely boy's face,
They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief,
stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other.
They were both in the gray gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs.
They reached the hotel and Rosemary walked a little behind him, to admire him, to adore him.
Dick's parties were all concerned with excitement, and a chance breath of fresh night air was the more precious for being experienced in the intervals of the excitement.

but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might,
while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that Father hoped ,

M. , and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,'
As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one,
Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa,
and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.
Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year's Eve.
Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say Christopher Columbus!'
Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking,
It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper,
for a real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,'
said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.
Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room,
and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that,
none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly.
when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.
Both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances.
for they had no brothers, very few male cousins,
and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.
and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said,
That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap,
Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.
but I suppose when I've learned to carry her without complaining,
she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan't mind her.'
And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.
and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work,
and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure loving youth.
Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will,
There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home,
declaring she couldn't bear it longer,
and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact,
that she couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she liked.
Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in,
and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket
and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,
unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.
When I think of this deggerredation,
I fell that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it.'
for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book,
and read like fury till she wakes up.
so the minute her cap began to bob like a top heavy dahlia, I whipped the VICAR OF WAKEFIELD out of my pocket,
and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt.
told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham.
And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.
A poor woman came in with a pail a mop,
and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish,
she said soberly, As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about Father,
another that, though she was poor,
she was a great deal happier,
with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts,
as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack,
and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.
It's cold and dull out,
and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do,'
looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it.
looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow balling one another.
The idea amused Jo. who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.
and when she beckoned him to his sofa,
he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...
for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.
asked the boy, changing the subject, after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.
Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.
It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities,
and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.
Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, Mercy me!
were kinder even than the painted ones,
and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal.
while Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs,
which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.
He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him,
and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.
It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks,
enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light,
Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see,
So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses.
Her respect and regard for the Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put on any airs.
but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.
When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body,
I am not sure,
but I think it was because his son,
Laurie's father, married an Italian lady,
and I hope Meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can.'
and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome,
their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs.
With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him,
Never having known mother or sisters,
he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him,
He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.'
But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it.
but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said Hey!
' so loud, she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano.
till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters.
and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner,
The boy neglects his music now,
and I'm glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it.
and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her,
She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his study door,
to hear the old fashioned airs he liked.
So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.
He is so kind to me, I must thank him,
and I don't know any other way.
After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,
the materials bought, and the slippers begun.
A cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty,
On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.
for there stood a little cabinet piano,
with a letter lying on the glossy lid,
directed like a sign board to
gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.
So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard.
only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved,
she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.
which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow,
and caused Miss March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock.
This much enduring man had succeeded in banishing,
chewing gum after a long and stormy war,
especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.
Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher,
At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes,
were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.
Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.
and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood,
and break her heart with crying.
A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place,
and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.
carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat,
as if she shook that dust of the place off her feet.
Yes, you can have a vacation from school,
but I want you to study a little every day with Beth,' said Mrs. March that evening.
It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,' sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.
When he was gone, amy, who had been pensive all evening,
said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,
Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once,
that folks may know you've got them,'
Now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are young, it is to be told that,
and to be bidden to run away, dear' is still more trying to us.
Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to find out the secret,
Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,' said Meg soothingly.
But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and princesses,
Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.
She assumed an injured air as they came in,
never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question.
On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's first look was toward the bureau,
for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and anger...
but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity,
and she felt that it never could be made up to her.
and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.
Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief and anger all away,
So she winked hard, shook her head,
and said gruffly because Amy was listening,
but I think she might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,' said Meg.
Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur trimmed coat and cap.
Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on,
but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river,
taking a bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister's troubles.
She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once.
Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn,
and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the the smoother ice in the middle of the river.
and after an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot fire.
but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles.
And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened,
bitterly condemning her hardness of heart,
and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.
I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some day,
and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me.
Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?
and for years had to struggle on alone,
for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else.
A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,
Yet you told him to go, Mother,
and didn't cry when he went, and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,'
Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty ,
and will surely be the happier for it in the end?
but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.
added Beth, tidily sorting neck ,
and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great occasion.
Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan,
which she called her ball dress' with an important air.
It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.
Before she could speak,
Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.
The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,' said Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.
offering them so prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw',
she saw a happy, bright eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair
She was sitting just inside the conservatory,
waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...
where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.
All this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...
And Meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover.
asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.
' How funny...
' She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly...
and then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,'
said Belle in her persuasive tone.
On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.
which was so tight she could hardly breathe,
and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror.
A cluster of tea rose buds at the bosom and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,
Mademoiselle is chatmante, tres jolie, is she not? ' cried Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.
Come and show yourself,' said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room where the others were waiting.
While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.
and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest.
and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side ache, the train kept getting under her feet,
and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.
She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty,
To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.
What shall you tell her? ' asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.
He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer, which had not particle of his usual politeness in it.
That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg walked away, saying petulantly,
Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks,
She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun,
he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.
Wish tomorrow was here, then,' muttered Laurie, walking off, ill pleased at the change he saw in her.
feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected.
Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had,
and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.
Meg suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying bravely...
I was very unwise to let you go among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly, ill bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people.
for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very much for letting me go.
if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.
on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp,
Again we meet to celebrate With badge and solemn rite, Our fifty second anniversary, In Pickwick Hall, tonight.
When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win,
Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a sound, but he dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush,
My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter.
for in his fall Mr.
Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water, upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments badly.
On being removed from this perilous situation, it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add, is now doing well.
She is useful and mild, and does her best, But she is not fair to see, And we cannot give her your place dear, Nor worship her as we worship thee.
I wish to propose the admission of a new member one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for it,
but all looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.
observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she always did when doubtful.
and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.
But the new member was equal to the occasion, and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most engaging manner,
the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time before order could be restored.
for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental.
and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care.
never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come.
I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.
I did actually run, and whisked round the corner whee I felt safe.'
Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls mean to,' proposed Amy.
I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play.'
Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree.
At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day.
had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her slightly cross.
and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat.
got so fidgety that even good natured Laurie had a quarrel with her,
so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was a fright'.
and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden.
who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner,
Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.
The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning
the canary, who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for want of
which he had died.
Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which was in a most discouraging state of confusion.
Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it.
Mrs. March went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went,
for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to ear.
surveying the feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.
Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.
Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a scramble to get ready to see them.
she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.
Yes,
I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully.
to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear,
Have regular hours for work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant,
she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in Marmee's corner',
and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.
One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill,
and think, perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the well worn cover of your guidebook.
And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.
I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,' said Amy, showing her mail.
Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play tomorrow with free minds,' said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a broom.
remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad brimmed, old fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.
and who was much flattered by Mr.
Ned's assurances that he came especially to see her.
for that young lady had a standoff don't touch me air, which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.
while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug.
face to face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity'. He was not very wise, but very good natured,
and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.
Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred,
who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.
especially when they beat them,' she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever stroke.
Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend,
So Jo, feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over the coffeepot,
The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves.
for everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by.
Thank you, I prefer spiders,' she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death.
I thought she'd suit Brooke,
but he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers'.
Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and the boys could not, eat any more,
said Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.
till he came to the palace of a good old king,
who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond.
for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish and wild.
One day, as he went prancing down a quiet street,
he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face.
Till you tell me how I may rescue you, swore the knight, still kneeling.
Instantly, Sir What's his name recovered himself,
pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to join the lady, victorious,
tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down
when the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below.
then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength,
he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist,
A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,' went on Meg.
It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.
So the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls.
So she asked what she should use for new heads,
since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed..'
She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way rejoicing,
Then he tried to push through,
but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair.
So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly,
for she picked her roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in.
asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole.
I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a while,' said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his tutor.
So did mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately,
and then she was quite willing I should go on.
for her tone implied it, and something in her face made Meg color,
and wish she had not been so frank.
Did the German song suit, Miss March? ' inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an awkward pause.
My father, who taught me, is away,
and I don't get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation.'
It's so hard I'm afraid to try,' said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.
Down the page went the green guide, and presently,
forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.
If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.
Very well indeed! ' said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.
Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,
said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.
Ned, mounted on the old horse,
came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.
and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics.
Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way,
said Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.
for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it.
As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice,
and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,
displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon,
he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general,
Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.
All walked quietly through the garden,
out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.
A grove of pines covered one part of it,
and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.
sewing daintily with her white hands,
and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green.
yet lingering because home seemed very lonely,
and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit.
saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up,
espied the wistful face behind the birches,
and beckoned with a reassuring smile.
said Jo, handing him the book.
as he began, doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the Busy Bee Society'.
use poles to climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.
the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky.
If people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get in,
said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.
After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.
I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit.
said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books.
I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen,' observed Jo mysteriously.
I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang college!
' muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.
Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,' replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew.
in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.
said Jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was excited by what she called Teddy's Wrongs'.
Do your best at college,
and when he sees that you try to please him,
I'm sure he won't be hard on you or unjust to you.
how he took good care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her.
And how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother,
and never tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be.'
So he is, dear old fellow! ' said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story.
It's like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him.
Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him,
asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way.
If you have plagued him,
he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work better.'
You are so kind to us,
we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think.
Ashamed of his momentary pique,
Laurie squeezed the kind little hand, and said frankly, I'm the one to be forgiven.
There's a demand for socks just now,'
added Jo, waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.
Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully,
It it she kept her papers, and a few books,
safely shut away from Scrabble,
who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves.
Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town,
for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street.
to the great amusement of a black eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite.
saying with a smile and a shiver, It's like her to come alone,
In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face,
and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort.
Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh,
which made several passers by smile in spite of themselves.
for you'll get to liking it better and better,
and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys.
Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability?
' asked Laurie, looking nettled.
And if you grow like him mother won't be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.
You know you have you can't hide anything, so up and fess, or I won't tell,' cried Laurie.
cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again,
to the great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,
for it is always pleasant to be believed in,
and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.
but I didn't promise not to,
so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy bit of news I get.
I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that,' said Jo rather ungratefully.
for his Atalanta came panting up with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.
Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.
What in the world are you doing here? ' she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well bred surprise.
said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.
and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near.
laughing, whispering, skipping stones, and behaving like children', as Meg said to herself,
though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on.
would sit looking at Meg with a woe begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner.
What shall we do with that girl?
She never will behave like a young lady,' sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.
Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,' returned Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.
How Meg wouldn't believe it till she saw the words.
Miss Josephine March,' actually printed in the paper.
How Hannah came in to exclaim, Sakes alive, well I never!
' in great astonishment at that Jo's doin's'.
cried the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish,
affectionate people mad a jubilee of every little household joy.
So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me,
and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.
If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a delightful month,' said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything, even November.
You're pretty enough and good enough already,
so I'd have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly.
Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad,
and come home my Lady Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance.'
said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.
but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window, said, smiling,
I've been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle,
and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.
asked Laurie, leaning over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.
read the two lines it contained,
and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart.
Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over,
and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never forgot,
poor things, as their mother sat up, looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.
I can go anywhere, do anything,' he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.
Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the table before her mother,
well knowing that money for the long,
sad journey must be borrowed,
and feeling as if she could do anything to add to a little to the sum for her father.
for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his life.
He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be back directly.
as Meg ran through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.
I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,' he said, in the kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit.
enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what she had often said before, and went on with her preparations,
with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there.
All other errands were done,
and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy goth tea,
and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it, It doesn't affect the fate of the nation,
No, I won't! ' returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned.
as they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble.
You had no winter things ,
and got the simplest with your own hard earnings,'
and without stopping to think,
I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine.'
for I got rather excited,
and told the story in my topsy turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly,
and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed.
All began bravely,
but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart,
Jo, laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk,
then amiably promised to make her hair curl,
and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,
but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution.
one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet,
a third putting on her overshoes, and a forth fastening up her travelling bag...
and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen.
It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts,
and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.
Meg insisted on reading the dispatches,
which grew more cheerful as the week passed.
and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long,
since he is so useful to you and Father.
He didn't come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.
he calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does.
but she starched em afore they was wrenched,
and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin.
girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little,
and began to fall back into old ways.
Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar,
and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful,
and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a visiting.
All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character,
and when the first excitement was over,
So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do well,
and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.
Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air will do you good,' said Jo,
when Beth quietly put on her hood,
filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children,
and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.
I saw in a minute it was sicker,
but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor,
so I took Baby and let Lotty rest.
I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk,
but it didn't stir, and I knew it was dead.'
I looked in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and queer feelings like mine,
I'll go and tell Amy,' said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.
Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared
that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March.
Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.
You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day,
driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.
and Amy, feeling very precious and self sacrificing, promised to go,
if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.
and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.'
but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.
squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.
cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the rattlepated' boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.
I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,' thought Amy, as she was left alone with Aunt March.
Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes
and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears,
learned to see the beauty and to sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts,
Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.
and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips,
Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute,
and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.
and Jo, standing with a pale face for a minute, ran to the parlor,
snatched up the telegram, and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm.
She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying that Mr.
March was mending again.
Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart,
and her face was so full of misery
As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks,
she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark,
It was the best thing he could have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words,
I'll send my bill, by and by, and tonight I'll give you some thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,'
but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't help flying at you.
Fly at me again. I rather liked it,' said Laurie, looking mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.
That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away,' said Hannah, with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.
A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.
for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch,
with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.
If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my life,' answered Jo, with equal fervor.
and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all,
a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.
It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow,
As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed,
for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words.
the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.
and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes,
the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face.'
It looks like a fairy world,' said Meg, smiling to herself, as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.
the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.
So she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago,
a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.
the lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders,
After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.
Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times.
which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page.
for he soon felt that she did not admire him,
and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.
called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.
Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with Madame', as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,
little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique.
replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.
Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.
and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training.
Esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut up rooms.
she borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did.
Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness.
As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers,
The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.
asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.
She was sorry she had so little to give,
and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa.
Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper.
she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last.
for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.
for everyone slept, spent with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house,
waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child,
like a miser over some recovered treasure.
Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit.
while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.
After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till night, and I'm not sure that he would,
They were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.
As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee,
Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile.
Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to the little plan.
and that's the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her.
Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!
' cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt.
for he told us he loved her,
but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him.
He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could.
They'll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to dodge.
Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,
and make a hole in the family,
but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon,
If rank and money come with love and virtue, also,
I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune,
for if I am not mistaken,
she will be rich in the possession of a good man's heart,
and that is better than a fortune.'
for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by and by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days.
Then he's rich and generous and good, and loves us all,
and I say it's a pity my plan is spoiled.'
I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg,
and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on.
Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up, when a pull her and a snip there would straighten it out.
The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret,
and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.
for he was an incorrigible tease,
and she feared he would coax the secret from her.
declared her knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,
Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.
I caught her singing that song he gave her, and once she said John', as you do,
Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from
Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.
' cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.
Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo,
saying reproachfully,
It's like his writing,' faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her hand.
I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew anything about it,' began Meg, without looking up.
I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew,
and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do.
Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands, exclaiming, with a laugh,
Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.
Do you love him enough to wait till her can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?'
but he knew the minute he saw Mrs.
March's face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.
When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot,
I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it out of me,
It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?
Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation.
La, no Miss,
but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman,
Seeing that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon her knees,
said Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.
I know Meg would wet blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had more spirit,' began Laurie insinuatingly.
as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands.
affected to be searching for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit.
She obediently descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.
said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.
said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.
Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech.
Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his table.
Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr.
Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.
and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom,
and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, Mrs. John Brooke',
whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.
Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms.
while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring,
celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.
After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces,
I'm sure I am,' echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.
Of course I am! ' cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first sild dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.
He might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement
which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen.
at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired.
how devoted Brooke had been,
and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man.
The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up,
stuffed, browned, and decorated.
Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr.
Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement.
Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table,
in which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.
said Meg, smiling at the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr.
Brooke with dignity.
I think it's been a pretty hard one,' observed Amy, watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.
I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,' whispered Beth, who sat on her father's knee.
he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm.
A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters,
He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with and unusually mild expression in her face.
I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears,
asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her father and told about her ring.
neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness.
Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr.
Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall.
for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands imploringly,
as if begging some boon.
If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush,
I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,' said Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.
If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books,
you'll give in, rather than hurt his feelings.'
holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter,
He seemed to think it was worth the trouble,
I'm too young,' faltered Meg, wondering was she was so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.
What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.
for she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr.
March's arrival, drove straight out to see him. Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.
If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn't think of it,
Aunt March put on her glasses ,
and took a look at the girl, for she did not know her in this new mood.
Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start,
So you intend to marry a man without money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now,
though I'm so poor and young and silly,' said Meg,
looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.
cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's suspicions.
Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up her mind, that she had told her John' to go away, and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.
And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon.
But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there,
staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes.
That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a word.
Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon the be, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy.
The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper,
with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged, Here comes Laurie.
Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy.
Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care. which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful.
I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's initials are M. M.
, and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,'
Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.
It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,'
said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink. stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden.
Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room,
and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly.
when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.
Both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances.
for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.
and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said,
That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap,
Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.
but I suppose when I've learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan't mind her.'
March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter. And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.
and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure loving youth.
Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will,
There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't bear it longer,
and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she liked.
and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual Josy phine!'
Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in,
and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket
If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed.
She was a great favorite with her mates, being good tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.
and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit.
When I think of this deggerredation, I fell that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it.'
for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up.
so the minute her cap began to bob like a top heavy dahlia, I whipped the VICAR OF WAKEFIELD out of my pocket,
and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt.
told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham.
And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.
A poor woman came in with a pail a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish,
she said soberly, As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about Father,
and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say good by to him, perhaps!
she was a great deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts,
as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.
The idea amused Jo.
who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.
And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked,
Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room.
Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did,
and had read even more than herself.
It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues,
and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities,
and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes,
and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.
as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo ,
arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather.
while Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs,
There was color, light, and life in the boy's face now,
vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.
He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him,
Her respect and regard for the Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put on any airs.
but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed,
and his grandfather came to his rescue.
When all the afternoon's adventures had been told,
the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body,
I am not sure, but I think it was because his son,
and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome,
their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs.
With the delightful enthusiasm of youth,
they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him,
He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there,
and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.'
But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano,
could not pluck up courage to go to the Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it.
but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity,
stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said Hey!
' so loud, she never told her mother, and she ran away,
declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano.
The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it,
for he was getting too fond of it.
and straightway forgot her fear, herself,
and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her,
So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn't always the case,
that her granted wish was all she had hoped.
He is so kind to me,
I must thank him, and I don't know any other way.
After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo,
the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun.
On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand,
and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.
for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to,
gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should tumble down,
it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.
Laurie told me how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died,
and how he kept all her little things carefully.
which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow,
This much enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war,
especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers,
and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.
Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra,
and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher,
At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray,
and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.
Amy started, and put both hands behind her,
turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.
and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood,
and stood there, so motionless ,
and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.
and Hannah shook her fist at the villain' ,
and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle.
carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat,
Yes, you can have a vacation from school,
but I want you to study a little every day with Beth,' said Mrs. March that evening.
even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one,
and the great charm of all power is modesty.'
Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,'
and to be bidden to run away, dear' is still more trying to us.
Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to find out the secret,
Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,' said Meg soothingly.
But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves,
and the gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it.
On going up to put away her best hat,
Jo's first look was toward the bureau,
for Jo's hot temper mastered her,
and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head,
crying in a passion of grief and anger...
she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret,
and finished her fight alone.
but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity,
and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident,
or her own generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and healed the breach.
Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom,
and cry her grief and anger all away,
Amy heard him say, as he shot away,
looking like a young Russian in his fur trimmed coat and cap.
Jo heard Amy panting after her run,
stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on,
but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river,
She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her,
as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once.
Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn,
and after an exciting time of it,
she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot fire.
but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles.
And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears,
telling all that had happened,
bitterly condemning her hardness of heart,
I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some day,
A startled or surprised look from one of you ,
when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,
and look at you with a very kind but sober face,
and you always folded your lips tight and went away.
Mu Jo, you may say anything to your mother,
for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me,
and know how much I love them.'
how much I owe him,
and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.'
Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went,
and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,'
but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength,
and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one.
added Beth, tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box,
lent for the great occasion.
I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs,
and the old ones cleaned up for common.'
Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan,
and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,
chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.
Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off,
and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.
The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,'
said Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.
offering them so prettily that Clara, the elder sister,
told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw',
she saw a happy, bright eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair,
She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,
when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...
where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached,
and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.
All this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it ,
till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...
and then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,
' said Belle in her persuasive tone.
On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid,
and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.
A cluster of tea rose buds at the bosom,
and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders,
Mademoiselle is chatmante, tres jolie, is she not?
' cried Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.
and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable,
enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.
While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt ,
and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.
and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the party,
inquired who she was with an air of interest.
for though he bowed and smiled,
yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on.
To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie,
who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.
What shall you tell her?
' asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.
He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer,
That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg walked away, saying petulantly,
She leaned her forehead on the cool pane,
and stood half hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun,
said Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.
and romping in a way that scandalized Laurie,
who looked on and meditated a lecture.
But he got no chance to deliver it,
for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good night.
and when the younger girls were gone to bed,
she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.
Meg suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth's stool,
leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying bravely...
but they flattered me and said I was a beauty,
and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.'
on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows:
Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp,
Again we meet to celebrate With badge and solemn rite,
Our fifty second anniversary, In Pickwick Hall, tonight.
Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who haunts her steps,
and is spurned by the old Count,'
Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a sound,
but he dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush,
for in his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,
upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments badly.
On being removed from this perilous situation, it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises,
and we are happy to add, is now doing well.
She is useful and mild, and does her best,
But she is not fair to see, And we cannot give her your place dear, Nor worship her as we worship thee.
I wish to propose the admission of a new member
one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for it,
but all looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.
observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she always did when doubtful.
and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag
, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.
But the new member was equal to the occasion,
and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair,
said in the most engaging manner,
for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent,
being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental.
and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care.
I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled.
I did actually run, and whisked round the corner whee I felt safe.'
Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls mean to,' proposed Amy.
Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree.
At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day.
had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her slightly cross.
and then found time hang so heavily,
that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat.
got so fidgety that even good natured Laurie had a quarrel with her,
so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was a fright'.
and when her sisters left her to amuse herself,
she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden.
who had a good deal of humor,
resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner,
Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again,
looking relieved but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.
the canary, who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended,
as if imploring the food for want of which he had died.
Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which was in a most discouraging state of confusion.
surveying the feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker,
whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.
Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful,
choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.
said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's dinner table.
which bore his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.
which took half the afternoon ,
and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.
Before the housewives could rest, several people called,
and there was a scramble to get ready to see them.
Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully.
One July day she came in with her hands full,
and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the pe nny post.
she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in Marmee's corner', and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.
and think, perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask,
if I may trust the well worn cover of your guidebook.
and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet have a fire,
make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks.
And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss,
more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.
said Amy, showing her mail,
I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,'
said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a broom,
Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play tomorrow with free minds,'
remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad brimmed, old fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.
and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances that he came especially to see her.
for that young lady had a standoff don't touch me air,
which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls.
while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug.
face to face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect ,
and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity'.
He was not very wise, but very good natured,
Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred,
It was not far to Longmeadow,
but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived.
Laurie threw up his hat,
then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult over the defeat of his guests,
and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend,
while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys made a fire ,
and got water from a spring near by.
for everything seemed fresh and funny,
and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by.
Three white headed children peeped over the fence,
and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main.
she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death,
Thank you, I prefer spiders,'
I thought she'd suit Brooke,
but he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers'.
Miss Kate did know several new games,
and as the girls would not, and the boys could not, eat any more,
said Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg,
who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.
a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,
for he had nothing but his sword and his shield.
till he came to the palace of a good old king,
but he was poor and could only go by each day,
watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine.
Till you tell me how I may rescue you,
swore the knight, still kneeling.
Instantly, Sir What's his name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window,
and turned to join the lady, victorious,
tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke,
and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below.
then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door,
went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist,
A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,' went on Meg.
Snuffbox,' said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the audience.
for she wanted to restore the poor things to life,
and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.
So the diver hoisted it up,
and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls.
since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed..'
She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way rejoicing,
asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river,
and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole.
said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his tutor,
I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a while,'
So did mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately,
for her tone implied it, and something in her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.
' inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an awkward pause,
Did the German song suit, Miss March?
My father, who taught me, is away,
said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her,
It's so hard I'm afraid to try,'
Down the page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone,
giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen.
If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short,
but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.
Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little tableau before her,
shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,
said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.
came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies,
and there was no more quiet that day.
Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,
looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way,
said Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.
As the four sisters went home through the garden,
Miss Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice,
and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon,
he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world,
when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash.
Peeping through the meshes of the hammock,
he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.
A grove of pines covered one part of it,
and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.
A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them,
feeling that he ought to go away,
yet lingering because home seemed very lonely,
espied the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.
said Jo, handing him the book,
Finish this story while I set my heel,'
I'm the one that will have to fight and work,
and climb and wait, and maybe never get in after all.'
If people really want to go, and really try all their lives,
I think they will get in,
' said Jo, after a little pause:
Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could live in them?
said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.
After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to,
I'd like to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.
I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like,
with plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit.
observed Jo mysteriously: I've got the key to my castle in the air,
but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen,'
Hang college! ' muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh,
I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it.
replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew,
Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,'
said Jo, always ready with a plan,
If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet,
and see how many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,'
I advise you to sail away in one of your ships,
and never come home again till you have tried your own way,'
said Jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit,
and whose sympathy was excited by what she called Teddy's Wrongs'.
Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him,
how he took good care of his own mother till she died,
and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her.
And how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone,
but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be.'
as Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story.
So he is, dear old fellow! ' said Laurie heartily,
It's like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know,
and to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him.
Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him,
If you have plagued him, he's sober and walks slowly,
as if he wanted to go back and do his work better.'
It was only to show that I cared how you get on,
and what is said here is said in confidence, you know,'
Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand, and said frankly,
I'm the one to be forgiven.
Remembering the conversation of the afternoon,
the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully,
It it she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,
and going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch,
swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.
Once there, she composed herself,
hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town,
and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived into the street ,
and walked away as rapidly as she came.
In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face ,
Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh,
for you'll get to liking it better and better,
' asked Laurie, looking nettled,
Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability?
You know you have you can't hide anything,
so up and fess, or I won't tell,' cried Laurie.
cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight of two ducks,
four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,
but I didn't promise not to, so I will,
for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy bit of news I get.
said Jo rather ungratefully: I don't think secrets agree with me,
I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that ,
for his Atalanta came panting up with flying hair, bright eyes,
ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.
Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property,
and Jo bundled up her braids,
hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again.
' she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well bred surprise,
What in the world are you doing here?
would sit looking at Meg with a woe begone face,
occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner.
Laurie and she were always making signs to one another, and talking about Spread Eagles,
' till the girls declared they had both lost their wits.
sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face,
What shall we do with that girl?
She never will behave like a young lady,'
Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,' returned Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.
How Meg wouldn't believe it till she saw the words.
Miss Josephine March,' actually printed in the paper.
cried the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish,
affectionate people mad a jubilee of every little household joy.
So I let him have the two stories,
and today this was sent to me,
and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.
for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart,
and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end.
said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything, even November.
If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a delightful month,'
You're pretty enough and good enough already,
Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over,
poor things, as their mother sat up, looking pale but steady,
and put away her grief to think and plan for them.
sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to add to a little to the sum for her father.
He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands,
and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be back directly.
as Meg ran through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other,
she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.
he said, in the kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit,
I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,'
Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington,
and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there.'
enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what she had often said before,
and went on with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way ,
which Jo would have understood if she had been there.
All other errands were done, and Meg and her mother,
busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy goth tea,
and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it,
It doesn't affect the fate of the nation,
No, I won't! ' returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned.
as they gathered about the table,
for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble.
and without stopping to think, I walked in,
asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine.'
for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly,
and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness,
the prospect of a fine day tomorrow,
and the happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed.
All began bravely, but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart,
It did not seem at all comical to Meg,
who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.
but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness ,
and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution.
Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens,
remember that you never can be fatherless.'
as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves,
I feel as if there had been an earthquake,' said Jo,
They drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins,
and in ten minutes were all right again.
Meg insisted on reading the dispatches,
which grew more cheerful as the week passed.
and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father.
He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes,
and feel like orphans, with you so far away.
There is only room for me to send my love,
and some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see.
I read every morning, try to be good all day,
and sing myself to sleep with Father's tune.
and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful,
and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a visiting.
All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character,
Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air will do you good,' said Jo,
when Beth quietly put on her hood,
and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest,
looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.
but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and let Lotty rest.
I looked in Mother's book,
and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and queer feelings like mine,
You've been over the baby every day for more than a week,
and among the others who are going to have it,
so I'm afraid you are going to have it, Beth.
Serve me right, selfish pig, to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!
Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March.
Amy protested that she would not go,
and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.
You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day,
driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.
The old lady likes me, and I'll be as sweet as possible to her,
so she won't peck at us, whatever we do.'
and Amy, feeling very precious and self sacrificing,
promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.
and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her,
so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.'
but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.
squalled Polly, dancing on her perch,
and clawing at the old lady's cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.
cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the rattlepated' boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.
Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room,
with that suffering little sister always before her eyes,
learned to see the beauty and to sweetness of Beth's nature,
to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts,
Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side,
for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.
She longed for her cats,
but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,
and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo.
Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.
and Jo, standing with a pale face for a minute,
ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm.
She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak,
Laurie came in with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again.
Jo read it thankfully,
but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of misery,
Laurie drew his hand across his eyes,
but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips.
I'll send my bill, by and by,
and tonight I'll give you some thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,'
Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine again, it makes me act so.'
I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up your rapture,
and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here.'
said Laurie, looking mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight,
Fly at me again,I rather liked it,'
said Hannah, with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news,
That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away,'
A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house,
and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.
with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those,
for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch,
and anxious fears of delay in the storm,
or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.
for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs,
held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words.
and now I mean to put it in my vase here,
so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face.'
Never had the sun risen so beautifully,
and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did,
said Meg, smiling to herself, as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight,
It looks like a fairy world,'
and for the first time in her life,
realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.
and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays,
giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way.
the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract,
as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.
So she took Amy by the hand,
and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago,
a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul,
and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.
and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving,
which was never dusted to suit.
After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons,
which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed.
Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to go out with him,
when they walked and rode and had capital times.
for he soon felt that she did not admire him,
and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.
The cook was bad tempered, the old coachman was deaf,
and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.
Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with Madame',
as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,
but Aunt March ordered her to change it,
and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her religion.
little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments,
some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique.
replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold ,
and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.
It would be excellent and charming,
and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it.
Esther fitted up the closet with a little table,
placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut up rooms.
for being left alone outside the safe home nest,
she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely
Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie,
whom she wanted as a second witness.
I couldn't help laughing, which made Poll swear,
and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.'
The last name was written in pencil,
and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.
asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,
with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.
Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke,
and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper.
she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her,
feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last.
for everyone slept, spent with watching,
and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house,
waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.
when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie's opinion,
that she behaved like a capital little woman'.
while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains ,
and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.
After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till night,
and I'm not sure that he would,
They were alone together in the chapel,
to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.
There are a good many hard times in this life of ours,
but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way.
She called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger,
and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me always.
Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing,
and listened respectfully to the little plan.
' cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt,
Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!
He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her,
and the right to make her love him if he could.
and she'll go and fall in love,
and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together.
and make a hole in the family,
but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can,
If rank and money come with love and virtue,
also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune,
for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the possession of a good man's heart,
Then he's rich and generous and good, and loves us all,
Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up, when a pull her and a snip there would straighten it out.
replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.
Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,'
The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one,
and as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret,
Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence,
he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.
I caught her singing that song he gave her,
and once she said John', as you do,
Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs,
when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.
Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled,
a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully,
and while I was deciding what to say,
I felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do.
I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet,
that I didn't wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father.
I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend,
but nothing more, for a long while.'
Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased,
and Jo clapped her hands, exclaiming, with a laugh,
telling me that he never sent any love letter at all,
and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names.
Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair,
and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.
Do you love him enough to wait till her can make a home for you,
or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?'
If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense,
don't tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues.
The instant Laurie's step was heard in the hall,
Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone.
but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face,
and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.
Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel,
having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.
It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?
Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him,
and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation.
La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about something,
which vexes the old gentleman,
Seeing that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him,
assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon her knees,
It's no use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself,
and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by.
answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first,
Yes, but you won't do it,'
affected to be searching for her book,
but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit.
I can't get a word from him, and whesn I threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.'
said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale,
and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.
said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her friend,
who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.
Jo was determined to have it out now,
and tried to look quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech.
but he tries my patience past bearing,
and I know how it will end, if we go on so.'
Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down,
with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his table.
Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed,
for Mr. Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.
and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters,
and waited for her at the bottom,
as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather,
who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.
and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk for stamps,
found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, Mrs. John Brooke',
Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble ,
that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms.
Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had bonfires,
skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way.
After many skirmishes and snubbings,
the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces,
The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name,
for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.
a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders,
and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.
how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts,
and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them.
Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away,
and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet.
for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness of the past,
and leaving only the sweetness of the present.
which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen.
how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man.
Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked,
rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat.
The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned, and decorated.
Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke,
at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement.
Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her father,
feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit.
said Meg, smiling at the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.
observed Amy, watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes,
I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back, ' whispered Beth, who sat on her father's knee.
he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back,
and two or three little hard spots on the palm.
A burnt offering has been made to vanity,
this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters,
He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite,
with and unusually mild expression in her face.
I rather miss my wild girl,
but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied.
but I do know that in all Washington ,
I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five and twenty dollars my good girl sent me.'
I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass,
and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears,
neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid,
who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness.
Jo had sudden fits of sobriety,
and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall.
for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair,
and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon.
And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away,
he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.
said Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie,
I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,'
holding the small hand fast in both his own,
and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter,
I want to know so much,
for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not.'
Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it.
If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke,
she would probably have declared she couldn't think of it,
Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl,
for she did not know her in this new mood.
she felt so brave and independent,
so glad to defend John and assert her right to love him, if she liked.
So you intend to marry a man without money, position, or business,
and go on working harder than you do now,
though I'm so poor and young and silly,' said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.
cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's suspicions.
Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up her mind,
that she had told her John' to go away, and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.
And slamming the door in Meg's face,
Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon.
That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much,
and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a word.
Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon the be,
Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy.
The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg,
and he proudly took her in to supper,
with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head,
and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged, Here comes Laurie.
Father and Mother sat together,
quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago.
Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own,
the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy.
the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.
Dr. Juvenal Urbino noticed it as soon as he entered the still darkened house,
At one window the splendor of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the stifling, crowded room that served as both bedroom and laboratory,
and two crumbling pewter trays under an ordinary light bulb covered with red paper.
he continued to wear a linen suit, with a gold watch chain across his vest, as smartly as he had in his younger years.
He compensated as much as he could for an increasingly disturbing erosion of memory by scribbling hurried notes on scraps of paper,
Year after year, during contemplative pauses on afternoons of chess, Dr. Urbino had seen the gradual covering over of the walls,
why that indomitable soldier, accustomed to fighting to the last drop of blood,
had left the final battle of his life unfinished.
But in the brief minutes the Doctor needed to study the unfinished game,
the inspector discovered an envelope among the papers on the desk, addressed to Dr. Juvenal Urbino,
and this was where he perfected his chess game with his father in law' s cronies and some Caribbean refugees.
Jeremiah de Saint Amour paid back every last penny with religious regularity,
and from the time he took his first picture of a child startled by the magnesium flash,
and plunged once again into the flood of unsavory revelations that might have changed his life, even at his age,
Dr. Urbino recalled without bitterness an antiquarian' s shop, No.
26 rue Montmartre in Paris, on an autumn Monday in the last century.
 They saw All Quiet on the Western Front, a film based on a book that had been popular the year before ,
and that Dr. Urbino had read, his heart devastated by the barbarism of war.
and thought it was because of the brutal scenes of wounded men dying in the mud.
because she preferred to evoke her dead lover as he had asked her to the night before, when he stopped writing the letter he had already begun,
to sell Jeremiah de Saint Amour' s house and all its contents,
which, according to the letter, now belonged to her,
In summer an invisible dust as harsh as red hot chalk was blown into even the best protected corners of the imagination ,
by mad winds that took the roofs off the houses,
along with all their domestic animals and kitchen utensils, tumultuously abandoned their hovels of cardboard ,
and tin on the edges of the swamps and in jubilant assault took over the rocky beaches of the colonial district.
with their stores of everything that could be bought and sold,
And so the very life of the colonial city, which the young Juvenal Urbino tended to idealize in his Parisian melancholy, was an illusion of memory.
on the shores of the world' s ocean rather than in the distant freezing capital under a centuries old drizzle that disturbed their sense of reality.
at four o' clock in the afternoon, the galleon San Jose set sail for Cadiz with a cargo of precious stones ,
and metals valued at five hundred billion pesos in the currency of the day;
Splendid hammocks from San Jacinto, with multicolored fringe along the sides ,
and the owner' s name embroidered in Gothic letters with silk thread, hung in the bedrooms along with the beds.
and in a corner, draped with a Manila shawl, was the piano that Dr. Urbino had not played for many years.
and had arranged in an almost demented order the three thousand volumes bound in identical calfskin with his initials in gold on the spines.
which consists of closing houses during the lethargy of August in order to keep out the burning air from the street,
and then opening them up completely to the night breezes.
to watch the heavy, ash gray freighters from New Orleans pass by,
and at dusk to see the wooden paddles of the riverboats with their shining lights,
purifying the stagnant garbage heap of the bay with the wake of their music.
as they attempted to catch the parrot,
who had flown to the highest branches of the mango tree when they took him from his cage to clip his wings.
Then, just for love of the labor, he taught him the Latin accompaniment to the Mass ,
and selected passages from the Gospel according to St.
because for two desperate hours the parrot refused to say a single syllable, ignoring the pleas and threats and public humiliation of Dr. Urbino,
who fought for the favors of a female who did honor to her name of Messalina,
for it took her longer to give birth to nine pups than to conceive another ten.
But no one could bear the continual flapping of their wings that filled the house with the reek of funeral wreaths.
which was to frighten with its mortal breath the bats and salamanders ,
and countless species of harmful insects that invaded the house during the rainy months.
until the gardener from the house next door found the courage to face him and hack him to pieces with his machete.
thanks to a fund organized by the Society for Public Improvement, of which Juvenal Urbino was honorary president,

So it was in no way peculiar to ask them to please get a distinguished parrot, with all the qualities of a gentleman, out of a tree.

Life would have been quite another matter for them both if they had learned in time that it was easier to avoid great matrimonial catastrophes than trivial everyday miseries.
and threatened to move back to her father' s old house,
which still belonged to her although it had been rented out for public offices, and live there by herself.
but it felt so comfortable to be back in his great grandparents' featherbed that he preferred to capitulate.
Let me stay here, he said.
said Dr. Urbino: But he was nothing more than a fugitive from Cayenne,
condemned to life imprisonment for an atrocious crime,
denatured by a Florentine architect who came through here like an ill wind blowing renovation,
and converted many seventeenth century relics into Venetian basilicas.
The preparations had begun three months earlier, for fear that something indispensable would be left undone for lack of time.
In the chaos of the storm Dr. Juvenal Urbino, along with the other late guests whom he had met on the road,
had great difficulty reaching the house,
but at last he had to accept the humiliation of being carried by Don Sancho' s men under a yellow canvas canopy.
Fermina Daza sat next to her husband, as she always did,

for opera fever infected the most surprising elements in the city,
and gave rise to a whole generation of Isoldes and Otellos and Ai das and Siegfrieds.
The other was his marriage to a beauty from the lower classes, without name or fortune,
After fifty years, his son, Marco Aurelio, a doctor like himself ,
and like all the family' s firstborn sons in every generation,
had done nothing worthy of note he had not even produced a child.
A group from the School of Fine Arts made a death mask that was to be used as the mold for a life size bust,

It had not been easy for her to regain her self control after she heard Digna Pardo' s shriek in the patio and found the old man of her life dying in the mud.

FLORENTINO ARIZA, on the other hand, had not stopped thinking of her for a single moment since,
Fermina Daza had rejected him out of hand after a long and troubled love affair fifty one years, nine months, and four days ago.
and its interior patio, with weeds in the flowerpots and a stone fountain with no water, resembled an abbey cloister.

was that he had come from San Juan de la Cie naga with his only daughter ,
and his unmarried sister soon after the cholera epidemic,
where for two centuries young ladies of society had learned the art and technique of being diligent and submissive wives.
and the fact that Fermina Daza studied there was sufficient indication of her family' s economic situation,
if not of its social position.
But her father' s strict regime soon provided an irremediable difficulty.
At her side, struggling to keep up with her, the aunt with the brown habit and rope of St.
Francis did not allow him the slightest opportunity to approach.
he idealized her, endowing her with improbable virtues and imaginary sentiments,
who dissuaded him from handing Fermina Daza his seventy pages of compliments,
so that she continued to wait for the rest of the year.

Certain that such an intricate relationship was understandable only with the complicity of his sister,
not only because Fermina Daza had warned him in her letters of her father's stormy character,

Florentino Ariza did not reveal the whole truth of the enterprise, but he informed himself thoroughly regarding his abilities as a diver and navigator.

Despite the tangle of clues, Florentino Ariza soon rejected the possibility that the oldest had been the perpetrator of the assault,
and with as much dispatch he also absolved the youngest,
but only because his avid observations of the three women ,
had persuaded him to accept as truth the profound hope that his sudden lover was in fact the mother of the caged infant.
That supposition was so seductive that he began to think about her with more intensity than he thought about Fermina Daza,
ignoring the evidence that this recent mother lived only for her child.
while the other two played Chinese checkers,
and when at last she managed to put him to sleep she would hang the wicker cage from the ceiling on the cooler side of the railing.
He even observed the changes in her breathing, watching the reliquary that hung on her batiste blouse
as he looked at her without dissimulation over the book he pretended to read,
and he committed the calculated impertinence of changing his seat in the dining room so that he would face her.
he waved goodbye to Rosalba,
and the three women responded in kind,
with a familiarity that cut him to the quick because his boldness came too late.
Then he felt alone in the world,
and the memory of Fermina Daza, lying in ambush in recent days, dealt him a mortal blow.
He knew that she was to have an elaborate wedding,
and then the being who loved her most,
who would love her forever, would not even have the right to die for her.
as she was about to give her vow of love and obedience to a man who wanted her for his wife only as a social adornment,
and if at times he sat down to pick at food, it was in the hope that Fermina Daza would be at the table ,
or, conversely, to deny her the homage of fasting for her sake.
At times his solace was the certainty that during the intoxication of her wedding celebration,
even during the feverish nights of her honeymoon,
the Captain gave the traditional farewell party,
with a woodwind orchestra composed of crew members, and fireworks from the bridge.
The minister from Great Britain had survived the odyssey with exemplary stoicism,
shooting with his camera the animals they would not allow him to kill with his rifles,
when he thought the moment had come for the newlyweds to flee in secret through a false door,
to give themselves over to the delights of their first night.
because in the marasmus of the sedatives he had resolved once and for all that he did not give a damn about the brilliant future of the telegraph ,
and that he would take this very same boat back to his old Street of Windows.
he threw his petate into the water,
and followed it with his eyes as it floated past the beacon lights of the invisible fishermen, left the lagoon, and disappeared in the ocean.
where he supposed that the lady of his misfortune was still dozing,
her head on the shoulder of her satiated husband.
Florentino Ariza was the first to jump on land from the mail sloop,
and from that time on he no longer detected the fetid reek of the bay in the city, but was aware only of the personal fragrance of Fermina Daza.
and sometimes they played billiards or conversed in the outdoor cafe s under the arches around the Plaza of the Cathedral,
One night during the war, the celebrated Widow Nazaret took refuge in his house,
because hers had been destroyed by cannon fire during the siege by the rebel general Ricardo Gaitan Obeso.
Florentino Ariza had not made love since he lost his virginity to Rosalba in the cabin on the boat,
and in this emergency it seemed natural to him that the widow should sleep in the bed and he in the hammock.
and in the meantime she removed her widow' s weeds and tossed them in the air,
She did it with so much joy, and with such well measured pauses,
that each of her gestures seemed to be saluted by the cannon of the attacking troops,
which shook the city down to its foundations.
When the troops of General Gaitan Obeso were defeated after a sixty three day siege,
she rebuilt the house that had been damaged by cannon fire,
On only one occasion did she hover on the edge of public scandal,
when the rumor circulated that Archbishop Dante de Luna had not died by accident after eating a plate of poisonous mushrooms but had eaten them intentionally,
With all his perseverance, he tried to teach her the tricks he had seen others perform through the peepholes in the transient hotel,
She never understood the charm of serenity in bed,
never had a moment of invention,
and her orgasms were inopportune and epidermic: an uninspired lay.
Little by little, listening to her sleep,
he pieced together the navigation chart of her dreams,
and sailed among the countless islands of her secret life.
And something else that from that time on would be her reason for living:
he convinced her that one comes into the world with a predetermined allotment of lays,
and whoever does not use them for whatever reason, one' s own or someone else' s, willingly or unwillingly, loses them forever.
Still, because he thought he knew her better than anyone else,
Florentino Ariza could not understand why a woman of such puerile resources should be so popular a woman, moreover,
The only explanation he could think of, one that could not be denied,
was that the Widow Nazaret had enough tenderness to make up for what she lacked in the marital arts.
But instead of their forming a permanent union, of the kind his mother dreamed about,
both used it to embark on a profligate way of life.
which he recorded with the rigor of a notary in a coded book,
recognizable among many others by the title that said everything: Women.
he had some twenty five notebooks, with six hundred twenty two entries of long term liaisons,
and he continued to believe it with a feeling of boundless freedom until one fateful Sunday when, with no warning and no presentiments,
, he saw her leaving High Mass on her husband' s arm,
besieged by the curiosity and flattery of her new world.
Although that was not her intention, it was the correct way to respond to anonymous letters,
from a class accustomed by the affronts of history to bow before faits accomplis.
who one day were convinced of the uselessness of their intrigues,
and appeared unannounced in the little Park of the Evangels as if it were their own home,
bearing recipes and engagement gifts.
so that the ladies with long last names could emerge from their shadowy sanctuaries,
and radiant in their own borrowed jewels,
three times President of the Republic, philosopher, poet,
and author of the words to the national anthem, as anyone could learn, from that time on, in some of the more recent dictionaries.
She was married forever after at the main altar of the Cathedral, with a Mass at which three bishops officiated,
at eleven o' clock in the morning on the day of the Holy Trinity,
who at that hour was delirious with fever, dying because of her,
lying without shelter on a boat that was not to carry him to forgetting.
During the ceremony, and later at the reception, she wore a smile that seemed painted on with white lead,
a soulless grimace that some interpreted as a mocking smile of victory,
The ship of the Compagnie Ge ne rale Transatlantique, its itinerary upset by bad weather in the Caribbean,
announced only three days in advance that its departure had been moved ahead by twenty four hours,
The last to leave saw Lorenzo Daza outside the port taverns,
sitting on the ground in the middle of the street, his tuxedo in ruins.
and her husband, a diligent physician, did not sleep at all so he could comfort her,
which was all that an overly distinguished physician knew how to do for seasickness.
after the port of Guayra, and by that time they had spent ,
so much time together and had talked so much that they felt like old friends.
On the fourth night, when both resumed their ordinary habits,
Dr. Juvenal Urbino was surprised that his young wife did not pray before going to sleep.
She was frank with him: the duplicity of the nuns had provoked in her a certain resistance to rituals,
but her faith was intact, and she had learned to maintain it in silence.
and when she came out in her chemise she covered ,
the cracks around the door with articles of clothing so she could return to bed in absolute darkness.
Dr. Urbino felt her slide in next to him like a startled little animal,
trying to keep as far away as possible in a bunk where it was difficult for two people to be together without touching.
and when he felt that her tension had given way he made his first attempt to raise her nightgown,
but she stopped him with an impulse typical of her character.
She took it off, in fact, and then she was so still that Dr. Urbino might have thought she was no longer there if it had not been for the glint of her body in the darkness.
he wet the tip of his forefinger and grazed her nipple when it was caught off guard,
and she felt a mortal explosion as if he had touched a raw nerve.
But he did not allow their fingers to intertwine;
instead he grasped her by the wrist and moved her hand along his body with an invisible but well directed strength
The child they had both longed for was born without incident under the sign of Aquarius ,
and baptized in honor of the grandfather who had died of cholera.
just as Florentino Ariza perceived them when he saw them leaving Mass two weeks after their return on that Sunday of his misfortune.
They came back with a new conception of life, bringing with them the latest trends in the world and ready to lead,
he with the most recent developments in literature, music, and above all in his science.
He had also arranged with his bookseller in Paris to receive works by the most widely read authors,
among them Anatole France and Pierre Loti,
but under no circumstances anything by Emile Zola,
whom he found intolerable despite his valiant intervention in the Dreyfus affair.
Fermina Daza, always resistant to the demands of fashion,
brought back six trunks of clothing from different periods,
for the great labels did not convince her.
but on the other hand she filled a trunk with sprigs of artificial cherries, stalks of all the felt flowers she could find,
branches of ostrich plumes, crests of peacocks, tailfeathers of Asiatic roosters, entire pheasants, hummingbirds,
before the spring winds leveled everything with ashes,
but she used it only once because she did not recognize herself in the new scent.
the terrifying blaze that destroyed almost all the gondolas off St. Mark' s Square in Venice,
which they witnessed with grieving hearts from the window of their hotel,
because someone said that he had said, although no one actually heard him say it,
that our Constitution was meant for a nation not of men but of angels.
who traveled to France went out of their way to see him.
of a snowy afternoon when they were intrigued by a crowd that defied the storm outside a small bookshop on the Boulevard des Capucines,
because Oscar Wilde was inside.
Dr. Urbino had stopped just to watch him,
but his impulsive wife wanted to cross the boulevard so that he could sign the only thing she thought appropriate, given the fact that she did not have a book:
She was sure that a man as refined as he would appreciate the gesture.
But her husband objected with firmness,
It was difficult to imagine anyone who could have assimilated the daily life of Paris with so much speed and so much joy,
He presented himself unannounced in the office of Uncle Leo XII,
President of the Board of Directors and General Manager of the River Company of the Caribbean,
and expressed his willingness to yield to his plans.
as willing to bring forth a spring of lemonade in the Guajira Desert as to flood,
a solemn funeral with weeping at his heartbreaking rendition of In Questa Tomba Oscura.
His head was covered with curls, he had the lips of a faun,
and all he needed was a lyre and a laurel wreath to be the image of the incendiary Nero of Christian mythology.
When he was not occupied with the administration of his decrepit vessels, still afloat out of sheer distraction on the part of fate,
or with the problems of river navigation, which grew more and more critical every day,
And yet, even when he had the resources to live like the Roman emperor he resembled,
Uncle Leo XII lived in the old city,
His strange nature, which someone once praised in a speech as lucid dementia,
allowed him to see in an instant what no one else ever saw in Florentino Ariza.
Uncle Leo XII disregarded what he said concerning his nephew' s bad taste in reading,
for Lotario Thugut would also say of him that he had been his worst voice student,
In any case, the German was correct in regard to what he had thought about least,
which was that Florentino Ariza wrote everything with so much passion that even official documents seemed to be about love.
helping unlettered lovers to write their scented love notes,
in order to unburden his heart of all the words of love that he could not use in customs reports.
everyone who crossed his path suffered the consequences of the overwhelming determination,
capable of anything, that lay behind his helpless appearance.
He fulfilled all his duties with admirable skill,
studying every thread in that mysterious warp that had so much to do with the offices of poetry,
but he never won the honor he most desired, which was to write one, just one, acceptable business letter.
Without intending to, without even knowing it,
he demonstrated with his life that his father had been right when he repeated until his dying day,
that there was no one with more common sense,
no stonecutter more obstinate, no manager more lucid or dangerous, than a poet.
He told him that Pius V Loayza used the offices for matters more pleasant than work,
and that he always arranged to leave the house on Sundays,
What is more, he had an old boiler installed in the warehouse patio,
with a steam whistle that someone would sound with navigation signals in the event his wife became suspicious.
According to his calculations, Uncle Leo XII was ,
certain that Florentino Ariza had been conceived on a desk in some unlocked office on a hot Sunday afternoon,
She survived him by many years,
destroyed by the bitterness of not having a child and asking God in her prayers for the eternal damnation of his bastard son.
who had at last gone into the river business,
because his older brother had been a very close collaborator of the German commodore Johann B.
Elbers, the father of river navigation.
and all bore her surname and the name of a pope chosen at random from the calendar of saints' days,
The man called Florentino was their maternal grandfather,
so that the name had come down to the son of Transito Ariza after skipping over an entire generation of pontiffs.
Florentino Ariza did not see the resemblance that people observed,
but according to his Uncle Leo XII, Pius V was also reprimanded for the lyricism of his documents.
In any case, he did not resemble him in the pictures, or in his memories of him,
or in the image transfigured by love that his mother painted,
or in the one unpainted by his Uncle Leo XII with his cruel wit.
He thought he knew that at one time his father slept there, very early in his love affair with Transito Ariza,
but that he did not visit her again after the birth of Florentino.
For many years the baptismal certificate was our only valid means of identification,
and Florentino Ariza' s, recorded in the parish church of St Tiburtius, said only that he was the natural s on of an unwed natural daughter called Transito Ariza.
This social condition closed the doors of the seminary to Florentino Ariza,
but he also escaped military service during the bloodiest period of our wars because he was the only son of an unmarried woman.
One day, after he waited much longer than usual,
his father gave him the coins and said: Take them and do not come back again.
But in time he was to learn that Uncle Leo XII, who was some ten y ears younger,
continued to bring money to Transito Ariza,
and was the one who took care of her after Pius V died of an untreated colic
The drama of Florentino Ariza while he was a clerk for the River Company of the Caribbean was that he could not avoid lyricism ,
because he was always thinking about Fermina Daza,
He answered it in a different style, one that was in tune with the emotions and the age of the girl,
and in a hand that also seemed to be hers,
He wrote, imagining to himself what Fermina Daza would have said to him ,
if she had loved him as much as that helpless child loved her suitor.
Two days later, of course, he had to write the boy' s reply with the same hand, style,
and kind of love that he had attributed to him in the first letter,
Florentino Ariza was so enraptured by the practical evidence of his dreams that he used time he did not have to write a Lovers',
Companion that was more poetic and extensive than the one sold in doorways for twenty centavos
for Transito Ariza flatly refused to dig out the earthenware jars, and squander the savings of a lifetime on a mad publishing venture.
As he was starting out in the River Company of the Caribbean,
and writing letters free of charge in the Arcade of the Scribes,
As indifferent and irregular as he had been until then regarding food,
that was how habitual and austere he became until the end of his days:
a large cup of black coffee for breakfast,
a slice of poached fish with white rice for lunch, a cup of cafe con leche and a piece of cheese before going to bed.
Winning back Fermina Daza was the sole purpose of his life,
and he was so certain of achieving it sooner or later that he convinced Transito Ariza to continue with the restoration of the house ,
so that it would be ready to receive her whenever the miracle took place.
and in the space where the old tobacco factory had been they put in an extensive garden with all kinds of roses,
This was the largest and airiest in the house,
and it had an interior terrace where it was pleasant to sit at night because of the sea breeze and the scent of the rosebushes,
The work took almost three years,
and it coincided with a brief civic revival owing to the boom in river navigation and trade,
and she did not recognize them after dealing with them for half a lifetime,
or she confused the affairs of one with those of another,
At first it seemed she was growing deaf,
but it soon became evident that her memory was trickling away.
he continued to hunt the abandoned little birds of the night for several years,
still hoping to find a cure for the pain of Fermina Daza.
not only because his interests lay elsewhere,
but because he did not like them to see him there under circumstances that were different from the chaste domesticity of the past.
He picked up serving girls in the parks,
black women in the market, sophisticated young ladies from the interior on the beaches,
gringas on the boats from New Orleans.
the ones who looked as if they could eat an alligator raw and tended to be the most passive in bed.
but the project met the same fate as the previous one after Ausencia Santander sent him tumbling with her old dog' s wisdom,
and then she felt free, in the middle of the day and at the front door,
to receive Rosendo de la Rosa, a riverboat captain,
Nevertheless, from the very first, Florentino Ariza was not as enthusiastic about the excellence of the cuisine or the exuberance of the lady,
of the house as he was about the beauty of the house itself.
On the sea terrace, sitting on his private ring, was a cockatoo from Malaya,
with unbelievable white plumage and a pensive tranquillity that gave one much to think about:
Ausencia Santander had to ask Florentino Ariza to help her,
drag the inert body of the beached whale to bed and undress him as he slept.
without agreeing to, without even suggesting it or proposing it to each other,
and for more than seven years they continued undressing wherever they could while the Captain was on a trip.
and he always went unannounced, whenever he wanted to, at any hour of the day or night,
and never once was she not waiting for him.
She would open the door as her mother had raised her until she was seven years old:
stark naked, with an organdy ribbon in her hair.
This was the cause of constant discord with Captain Rosendo de la Rosa,
because he had the superstitious belief that smoking naked brought bad luck,
But then he would wake for no reason in the middle of the night,
and the memory of the self absorbed love of Ausencia Santander was revealed to him for what it was:
Despite the fact that from the first day he had felt very comfortable in the house that he now loved as if it were his own,
he had never stayed longer than two hours, and he had never slept there,
and he had eaten there only once because she had given him a formal invitation.
At five o' clock, with the sun still high, she jumped out of bed,
naked as always and with the organdy ribbon in her hair, and went to find something to drink in the kitchen.
All that was left were empty rooms with the four open windows,
and a message painted on the rear wall:
This is what you get for fucking around.
Florentino Ariza continued to visit her in the looted house,
whose furnishings were reduced to three leather stools that the thieves forgot in the kitchen,
and the contents of the bedroom where the two of them had been.
not because of the desolation in the house, as she supposed and as she said to him, but because of the novelty of a mule drawn trolley at the turn of,
the new century, which proved to be a prodigious and original nest of free flying little birds.
Later, when Uncle Leo XII put at his disposal a carriage drawn by two little gray mules with golden trappings,
In fact, he almost always left it hidden at his house,
and made his hawkish rounds On foot so that he would not leave wheel marks in the dust.
However, in the midst of so many tender memories,
he could not elude his recollection of a helpless little bird whose name he never knew,
and with whom he spent no more than half a frenetic night,
Then he put on a rented cape, and the two of them joined the dancing in the Plaza of the Customhouse,
and enjoyed themselves like newborn sweethearts,
You don' t know the trouble you' ve gotten into with me, she shouted, laughing in the fever of Carnival.
I' m a crazy woman from the insane asylum.
And so before the night began to degenerate, as it always did after prizes were distributed for the best costumes,
he suggested to the girl that they go to the lighthouse to watch the sunrise.
In fact, the girl had indicated to him that they should leave for the lighthouse,
when she was seized by two guards and a nurse from Divine Shepherdess Asylum.
and he would show them the box of chocolates in case luck would have it that she, too, might look out at him through the iron bars.
But he never saw her.
Months later, as he was getting off the mule drawn trolley,
a little girl walking with her father asked him for a piece of chocolate from the box he was carrying in his hand.
Florentino Ariza got off at the Plaza of the Carriages,
which was the end of the line, hurried through the labyrinth of commerce because his mother was expecting him at six,
and when he emerged on the other side of the crowd,
he heard the tapping heels of a loose woman on the paving stones and turned around so that he would be certain of what he already knew:
and then all they could do was to use sex as if it were a bandit' s knife
and put it to the throat of the first man they passed on the street: your prick or your life.
But with what he had learned over the years, Florentino Ariza stated it another way:
The world is divided into those who screw and those who do not.
when they strayed from the straight and narrow,
it was something so unusual for them that they bragged about love as if they had just invented it.
Those who did it often, on the other hand, lived for that alone.
They felt so good that their lips were sealed as if they were tombs,
they confided in no one, they feigned indifference to the point where they earned the reputation of being impotent,
or frigid, or above all timid fairies, as in the case of Florentino Ariza.
What she wanted from him was not love, least of all love that was paid for,
but a job, any kind of job, at any salary, in the River Company of the Caribbean.
The building was of wood, with a sloping tin roof,
a single long balcony with columns at the front, and windows, covered with wire mesh,
on all four sides through which one had complete views of the boats at the dock as if they were paintings hanging on the wall.
Later it was painted all blue,
and at the time that Florentino Ariza began to work for the company it was a dusty shed of no definite color,
Behind the building, in a gravel patio surrounded by chicken wire,
stood two large warehouses of more recent construction,
the debris of historic boats, from the early one with a single smokestack,
christened by Simon Bolivar, to some so recent that they had electric fans in the cabins.
but many were in such good condition that it seemed possible to give them a coat of paint ,
and launch them without frightening away the iguanas or disturbing the foliage of the large yellow flowers that made them even more nostalgic.
The next day, when Florentino Ariza came into his office, he found a memorandum from Leona Cassiani,
with the request that he study it and then show it to his uncle if he thought it appropriate.
in the midst of his disasters as a tireless falconer and the more and more uncertain dream of Fermina Daza,
Florentino Ariza leaned both hands on his umbrella, just as he had done in Oil Lamp Alley when he barred her way,
the son she had conceived in love and raised for love was immune to any kind of love because of his first youthful misfortune.
and his fondness for mystic ceremonies and strange lotions,
shared the suspicion that he was immune not to love but only to women.
Until that time he had maintained the fiction that it was the world that was changing,
and its customs and styles:
She said it as she walked past him and saw a print of Fermina Daza disguised as a black panther at a masquerade ball,
Then Florentino Ariza extended his index finger, wet with brandy, so that she could suck it, as she had liked to do in the past during their preambles to love.
So many widows in his life, since the Widow Nazaret,
had made it possible for him to discern how happy they were after the death of their husbands.
Fermina Daza had rejected Florentino Ariza in a lightning flash of maturity which she paid for immediately with a crisis of pity,
It was then that Fermina Daza experienced the revelation of the unconscious motives that had kept her from loving him.
God alone knows what it cost Fermina Daza not to accompany her cousin when she went to meet Florentino Ariza in the telegraph office.
But later, jealous of her carefully won privileges, fearful of embarrassment and scorn,
she demonstrated her willingness to endure even humiliation
in which everything was the way it used to be and for five minutes ,
they were once again the uninhibited lovers of their honeymoon.
The house left by her father gave Fermina Daza a refuge from the asphyxiation of the family palace.
whose mind had been left almost without memories, see him reading in the armchair he always sat in,
and the street door sealed,
and the space arranged just as he had heard her describe Roachie Martinez' s bedroom,
the beautiful pigeon fancier saw the gift carrier pigeon in the dovecote and thought it had escaped.
She had returned to Europe three times after the unfortunate trip from which she had intended never to return so that she would not have to live in perpetual turmoil.
They said that one midnight the previous June someone had seen her boarding the Cunard ocean liner en route to Panama,
and as he did so he discovered in amazement that this marvelous creature was as beautiful inside as out,
while his daughter catechized neighborhood children in the living room with recited passages of scripture.
Dr. Juvenal Urbino never thought that a physician his age,
who believed he had seen everything,
It was true: all he needed in life, even at the age of fifty eight,
was someone who understood him.
and a number of frightened families either canceled their service ,
or refused to have a telephone for many years.
their unhurried happiness for as long as they lived everything he had promised in the blazing heat of love was canceled forever after.
and God alone knows how much grief his heroic resolve cost him or how many bitter tears he had to shed behind ,
the locked lavatory door in order to survive this private catastrophe.
and grow indignant at the false accusation,
and shout curses at this ill begotten society that did not hesitate to trample on one' s honor,
But her husband' s allowing his confessor to be privy to an intimacy that was not only his but hers as well was more than she could bear.
She was sure that her honor was the subject of gossip even before her husband had finished his penance,
the best she could on her apron, arranged her appearance the best she could,
called on all the haughtiness she had been born,
Later he took refuge in the new custom of combing long hairs from his part on the right all the way across his head, and this he never abandoned.
His singular interest in false teeth,
had developed on one of his first trips along the Magdalena River and was the result of his maniacal love for bel canto.
and the next week an enormous double couch covered in a Dionysian flowered print was delivered through the window because it was too big for the doors.
The other had been finding, despite all the obstacles that destiny had interposed,
a successor worthy of the company.
and all that remained of her on the moonlit roofs was a fluttered farewell with a white handkerchief like a solitary sad dove on the horizon,
It was not until her daughter Ofelia came from New Orleans with her husband and the three girls that she sat at a table again to eat,
He was not the pitiable phantom who had haunted her in the Park of the Evangels,
and whom she had evoked with a certain tenderness after she had grown old,
much less to believe that the taciturn boy, so vulnerable in the rain,
was the moth eaten old wreck who had stood in front of her with no consideration for her situation,
and his rare lotions, and that he would continue to be so enigmatic after making his way in life in so spectacular and honorable a manner.
In some houses, half naked men and women were trying to salvage whatever God willed from the flood,
They had spent many nights like this after she had been left a widow without children.
and who was also convinced that he would be alive and in perfect possession of his male faculties the next day, or the day after that,
that there was no other remedy for her solitary widow' s yearnings than to lower the drawbridge for him.
in keeping with another of his superstitions, not disproved so far,
that the body carries on for as long as you do.
No: now she was a full fledged woman,
who liked to take the initiative.
she added salt to taste, pepper, a clove of garlic, chopped onion, lemon juice, bay leaf,
Through almost the entire ceremony, Fermina Daza stood in the family pew in front of the main altar,
as elegant as when she attended the opera.
his consuming need for her to love him in the same ritual of inopportune kisses ,
and tender words with which he loved her.
displacing the humans, forcing them back into the corners,
until Fermina Daza pushed the objects out of sight.
to let Florentino Ariza know that she, too, thanks to his letters of encouragement, was prepared to erase the past.
He was prepared not to be received,
even with an amiable excuse,
and that certainty kept him calm.
She thought that he would at last be convinced of the unreality of his dream,
and that this would redeem his insolence.
It seemed incredible that he, the owner,
had only traveled the river once, many years ago, before he had anything to do with the company.
In it he begged her pardon for the impertinence of attempting to visit her without first obtaining her permission,
and he promised never to return.
One morning, as he was cutting roses in his garden,
Florentino Ariza could not resist the temptation of taking one to her on his next visit.
He thought that the world would make more rapid progress without the burden of old people.
but he refused to accept the fatality of not seeing Fermina Daza the following afternoon,
for the first time in four months.
Later she reproached him for his fruitless insistence on not permitting himself to grow old in a natural way.
not a single moment of her own despised youth, had made her feel that Tuesday afternoons without him could be as tedious,
as lonely, and as repetitious as they really were.
In any case, it did not seem that the purpose of the story,
was to sully the name of Dr. Juvenal Urbino, whose memory enjoyed universal respect,
The facts were that two government agents had come to the house on the Park of the Evangels with a warrant,
by sheer accident, she found the typed copies of the meditations of Florentino Ariza and the handwritten letters of Fermina Daza,
was carrying on an equivocal relationship,
that did more harm to the family' s good name than the villainies of Lorenzo Daza or the ingenuous adventures of Juvenal Urbino.
I do not have the strength to give you the beating you deserve for being insolent and evil minded, she said.
a large, enclosed observation deck with hanging ferns ,
and an unobstructed view toward the front and both sides of the boat,
and a silent cooling system that kept out external noises,
and maintained a climate of perpetual spring.
The ship' s Captain honored Dr. Urbino Daza and his wife,
and Florentino Ariza, with champagne and smoked salmon.
From time to time one could see a straw hut next to the great bonfires signaling that wood for the ships' boilers was on sale.
He extricated them from their difficulty by spending ,
the next two hours explaining the controls and the general operation of the ship.
But when the boat weighed anchor again there was a cool breeze ,
scented with the heart of the forest,
and the music became more lively.
But that night she could bear it because she felt untroubled and calm,
as she had few times in her life: free of all blame.
The important thing was that not since the afternoon ,
when Aunt Escolastica left her missal on the counter in the telegraph office
and one morning when she awoke it stopped suddenly and completely,
like the sound of a smashed cicada.
and as the anisette left her in slow waves,
she was invaded by the anguished fear that he was angry and would never return.
In that sad place of death, where Florentino Ariza relived his memories of Rosalba when he saw the train from Envigado struggling to climb the old mule trail,
and in half a day he could play the waltz of The Crowned Goddess for her, and he played it for hours until they forced him to stop.
not of rage, at the memory of the old couple in the boat beaten to death by the boatman.
The wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait,
and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric a brac from the low mantel.
He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him,
and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men.
He was surrounded by the unknown, apprehensive of what might happen,
ignorant of what he should do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly,
fearful that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted.
He was keenly sensitive, hopelessly self conscious,
the amused glance that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a dagger thrust.
He cursed himself for having come, and at the same time resolved that,
happen what would, having come, he would carry it through.
outside the line of surf, a pilot schooner, close hauled, heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible,
was surging along against a stormy sunset sky.
The book was closed on his forefinger,
and before he turned he was thrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but of her brother's words.
At the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness, his thoughts,
sympathies, and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame.
He was extraordinarily receptive and responsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference.
Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl, Iseult, in the book there on the table.
A flood of associations, visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women,
rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it.
while about her were limned many women,
all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance,
herself the unit of weight and measure.
These, in turn, were crowded out by Japanese women, doll like, stepping mincingly on wooden clogs;
by Eurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy;
All these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood frowsy,
shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel, gin bloated hags of the stews,
and all the vast hell's following of harpies, vile mouthed and filthy,
He waved his hand deprecatingly ,
and muttered that it was nothing at all, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it.
Also, with quick, critical eye, she noted a scar on his cheek,
another that peeped out from under the hair of the forehead,
Likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore, the cheap,
and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders,
and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.
While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all,
he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair.
in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot, starry night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach,
the lights of the sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance,
the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the Mexican's face,
the glint of the beast eyes in the starlight, the sting of the steel in his neck,
and the rush of blood, the crowd and the cries, the two bodies, his and the Mexican's,
locked together, rolling over and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar.
Such was the picture, and he thrilled to the memory of it,
wondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilot schooner on the wall.
The white beach, the stars, and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great,
he thought, and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters.
He felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his sunburned cheeks,
though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace door in the fire room.
Even as she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk,
and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.
;It was just an accident,; he said, putting his hand to his cheek.
;One night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main boom lift carried away, an' next the tackle.
;Oh,; she said, this time with an accent of comprehension,
though secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering what a _lift_ was and what _swatted_ meant.
;This man Swineburne,; he began, attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the i long. ;Who?;
He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge of the chair,
holding tightly to its arms with his hands,
as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor.
He had succeeded in making her talk her talk, and while she rattled on,
he strove to follow her, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face.
Follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases,
and thought processes that were foreign to his mind,
but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling.
She lent wings to his imagination, and great, luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague,
gigantic figures of love and romance, and of heroic deeds for woman's sake for a pale woman, a flower of gold.
He listened as well, but he stared,
unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes.
while her instincts rang clarion voiced through her being,
impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world,
to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat,
who, all too evidently, was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence.
Like silver, he thought to himself, like tinkling silver bells;
and on the instant, and for an instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink cherry blossoms,
he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling straw sandalled devotees to worship.
He could not express what he felt,
and to himself he likened himself to a sailor,
in a strange ship, on a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging.
he broke in impulsively, spurred on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book knowledge,
desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod.
Her gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck, heavy corded, almost bull like,
bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health and strength and though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt drawn to him.
She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had,
who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.
She beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge, and said:
;That depends upon how much studying you have already done.
You have never attended high school?
Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns entering the London theatres while he stood ,
and watched and the policemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning.
wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with sheath knives and fingers,
or scooping thick pea soup out of pannikins by means of battered iron spoons.
The stench of bad beef was in his nostrils,
while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers and groaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth noises of the eaters.
to feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod, and to have his mind ever,
and again straying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her.
Also, when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite him, or to any one else,
to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion,
that person's features were seized upon by his mind,
which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what they were all in relation to her.
Then he had to talk,
to hear what was said to him and what was said back and forth, and to answer, when it was necessary, with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant curb.
He had heard of such things, and now, sooner or later,
somewhere in the next few minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings who used them ay, and he would use them himself.
and there were still more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail in such course, that his nature was not fitted to live up to it,
and that he would make a fool of himself.
He heard words spoken that were meaningless to him,
and other words that he had seen only in books ,
and that no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to pronounce.
;By God! ; he cried to himself, once; ;I'm just as good as them,
and if they do know lots that I don't, I could learn 'm a few myself, all the same!
the next moment, when she or her mother addressed him as ;Mr. Eden,;
his aggressive pride was forgotten, and he was glowing and warm with delight.
filled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for words, debating over words he knew were fit ,
but which he feared he could not pronounce,
He was swiftly mastered by the concept or sensation in him that struggled in birth throes to receive expression and form,
and then he forgot himself and where he was, and the old words the tools of speech he knew slipped out.
On the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant,
the servant was smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification.
He caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and, being in explanatory mood, he said:
;I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers.
;It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did and you a stranger,;
she said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture though not of the reason for it.
And while Arthur took up the tale, for the twentieth time,
of his adventure with the drunken hoodlums on the ferry boat and of how Martin Eden had rushed in and rescued him,
that individual, with frowning brows, meditated upon the fool he had made of himself,
and wrestled more determinedly with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward these people.
But in the meantime, talk he must, and it must be his own talk,
toned down, of course, so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to shook them too much.
And furthermore, he wouldn't claim, not even by tacit acceptance, to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar.
For the first time he became himself, consciously and deliberately at first,
but soon lost in the joy of creating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners' eyes.
He selected from the vast mass of detail with an artist's touch,
drawing pictures of life that glowed and burned with light and color,
injecting movement so that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence, enthusiasm, and power.
but beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence,
and tragedy was relieved by humor, by interpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors' minds.
She wanted to lean toward this burning,
blazing man that was like a volcano spouting forth strength, robustness, and health.
Before his facile perils and ready laugh, life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint,
but a toy, to be played with and turned topsy turvy,
carelessly to be lived and pleasured in, and carelessly to be flung aside.
She wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the thought,
and in vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture,
and balanced all that she was against what he was not.
Later, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively,
with the vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that separated them.
But he had caught hints of such music from the books,
and he accepted her playing largely on faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the lifting measures of pronounced and simple rhythm,
puzzled because those measures were not long continued.
he beat up against the southeast trades through long tropic days,
sinking palm tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting palm tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead.
One instant he was astride a broncho and flying through the fairy colored Painted Desert country;
the next instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of Death Valley,
The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires,
in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love calls of the singers, who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom toms.
all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was the strings;
and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams.
he went on oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high adventure and noble deeds to Her ay, and with her,
winning her, his arm about her, and carrying her on in flight through the empery of his mind.
It was a transfigured face, with great shining eyes that gazed beyond the veil of sound,
and saw behind it the leap and pulse of life and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit.
but these seemed the prison bars through which she saw a great soul looking forth,
inarticulate and dumb because of those feeble lips that would not give it speech.
But the impression of that fleeting glimpse lingered, and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling retreat and go,
she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and another of Browning she was studying Browning in one of her English courses.
He seemed such a boy, as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks,
that a wave of pity, maternal in its prompting, welled up in her.
She did not remember the lout, nor the imprisoned soul, nor the man who had stared at her in all masculineness and delighted and frightened her.
She saw before her only a boy,
who was shaking her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt like a nutmeg grater and rasped her skin,
Her face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along, pale and serious, sweet and sensitive,
smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile,
and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be.
Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her,
sharing thoughts with her, pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her.
Sensation usurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had never known,
drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling itself was exalted ,
and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of life.
that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking with her,
sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle.
As he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy cart,
left there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces, and brought up against a door with a resounding bang.
His mind went back to the house he had just left, and he saw, first,
the paintings, and next, Her, looking at him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at leaving.
Martin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent, cowardly,
and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same eyes when their owner was making a sale in the store below subservient eyes, smug, and oily, and flattering.
They did not have it in their souls to know beauty,
or they would have known that those shining eyes and that glowing face betokened youth's first vision of love.
;He said something about a schooner that's gettin' ready to go off to some outlandish place to look for buried treasure,
that he'd sail on her if his money held out.;
He extracted great happiness from squelching her,
and she squelched easily these days,
though it had been different in the first years of their married life,
before the brood of children and his incessant nagging had sapped her energy.
Martin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his brother in law,
felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room,
a tiny cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash stand, and one chair.
but fell to staring at the white plaster wall opposite him, broken by long streaks of dirty brown where rain had leaked through the roof.
Never having been conscious of himself,
he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love from women,
and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his youth.
Though they had often bothered him, he had never bothered about them;
and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him.
Always in sublime carelessness had he lived, till now,
and now it seemed to him that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands.
But he, who for the first time was becoming conscious of himself, was in no condition to judge,
and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy.
His eyes were made for seeing,
but up to that moment they had been filled with the ever changing panorama of the world,
at which he had been too busy gazing, ever to gaze at himself.
Above a square domed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair, nut brown,
with a wave to it and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman,
making hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through it.
But he passed it by as without merit, in Her eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high, square forehead,
striving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its content.
nor did he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother skins than he fairer,
than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun.
Strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect,
compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were wholesome.
He held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself,
and which no brush could scrub away.
He saw her yearning, hungry eyes,
and her ill fed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity;
And then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and up through the other vision, displacing it,
glimmered Her pale face under its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.
He awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere that smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes,
and that was vibrant with the jar and jangle of tormented life.
As he came out of his room he heard the slosh of water, a sharp exclamation,
and a resounding smack as his sister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny.
at the same time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket,
where he carried his money loose in the same large way that he lived life in general,
;Come here, Alfred,; he called to the crying child,
It came to him, in a flash of fancy, that her nature seemed taking on the attributes of stale vegetables, smelly soapsuds,
and of the greasy dimes, nickels, and quarters she took in over the counter of the store.
Martin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart,
the image of her red face and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain.
when she would dance with the best, all night, after a hard day's work at the laundry,
and think nothing of leaving the dance to go to another day's hard work.
then he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as it resided in all about her,
Her kiss would be like her hand shake or the way she looked at one, firm and frank.
In imagination he dared to think of her lips on his,
and so vividly did he imagine that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through clouds of rose petals, filling his brain with their perfume.
Jim was a plumber's apprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament, coupled with a certain nervous stupidity,
promised to take him nowhere in the race for bread and butter.
Martin nodded that he heard, it was a habit of nature with him to pay heed to whoever talked to him,
and poured a cup of lukewarm coffee.
He did not know the way of libraries,
and he wandered through endless rows of fiction,
till the delicate featured French looking girl who seemed in charge,
told him that the reference department was upstairs.
he breathed a great oath, passionately, under his breath,
swearing that his brain could do what theirs had done.
if she wouldn't, he would live a good life among men,
because of Her, and he would quit drinking anyway.
was the way he worded it to himself,
When you meet a young lady and she asks you to call, how soon can you call_?
He had not found what he wanted, though he had found that it would take all of a man's time to be polite,
and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which to learn how to be polite.
And for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and straight and awkwardly,
until he forgot himself in his thoughts, whereupon his rolling gait gracefully returned to him.
With four cards permitting him to draw books,
he burned the gas late in the servant's room,
and was charged fifty cents a week for it by Mr. Higginbotham.
He had bought a dictionary, which deed had decreased his supply of money,
and brought nearer the day on which he must sail in search of more.
but night found him lurking like a thief around the Morse home,
stealing glimpses at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her.
once he trailed Mr. Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets,
longing all the while for some quick danger of death to threaten so that he might spring in and save her father.
One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a bank,
and received another proof of the enormous distance that separated Ruth from him.
He had never been inside a bank in his life,
and he had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful.
While purchasing it, the clerk glanced at his nails, suggested a nail file,
and so he became possessed of an additional toilet tool.
He ran across a book in the library on the care of the body,
and promptly developed a penchant for a cold water bath every morning,
much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr. Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high fangled notions,
and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water.
Now that Martin was aroused in such matters,
he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class,
and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class.
Whenever he encountered a chance shipmate, and there were many in San Francisco,
he treated them and was treated in turn, as of old
, but he ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and good naturedly endured their chaffing.
They had their limitations to forget, and when they were drunk,
their dim, stupid spirits were even as gods, and each ruled in his heaven of intoxicated desire.
He was drunken in new and more profound ways with Ruth,
He saw her come down the aisle,
with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop of hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy.
He saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle,
and little else than her did he see that night a pair of slender white shoulders ,
and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with distance.
But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at those about him,
he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front, a dozen seats along,
and who smiled at him with bold eyes.
He could not re thumb himself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature;
so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls in warm human friendliness.
Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world,
so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of his class, that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow.
that there would be no overtures from these girls;
and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down.
He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act,
intent on seeing Her as she passed out.
There were always numbers of men who stood on the sidewalk outside,
and he could pull his cap down over his eyes and screen himself behind some one's shoulder so that she should not see him.
The black eyed girl smiled gratification and greeting,
and showed signs of stopping, while her companion, arm linked in arm, giggled and likewise showed signs of halting.
He was at home here, and he held his own royally in the badinage,
bristling with slang and sharpness, that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in these swift moving affairs.
And he measured her in a careless way, and knew, bold now,
that she would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately, as he pursued, ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted.
Good, as goodness might be measured in their particular class,
hard working for meagre wages and scorning the sale of self for easier ways,
nervously desirous for some small pinch of happiness in the desert of existence,
and facing a future that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the black pit of more terrible wretchedness, the way whereto being briefer though better paid.
And while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them,
before his inner sight towered the book shelves of the library, filled with the wisdom of the ages.
then she was gone and he was left staring at the two girls of the cannery,
at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress, their tragic efforts to be clean and trim,
the cheap cloth, the cheap ribbons, and the cheap rings on the fingers.
;Well, I was whisperin' it'd be a good idea if you could dig up a gentleman friend for her;
indicating her companion , ;and then, we could go off an' have ice cream soda somewhere, or coffee, or anything.;
Ranged side by side with the bold, defiant eyes of the girl before him, he saw Ruth's clear, luminous eyes,
like a saint's, gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity.
under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at a window and murmured:
;That date was with you, Ruth.
Time and again he nerved himself up to call,
but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away.
He did not know the proper time to call, nor was there any one to tell him,
and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable blunder.
Having shaken himself free from his old companions and old ways of life,
and having no new companions, nothing remained for him but to read,
and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a dozen pairs of ordinary eyes.
It had never been jaded by study,
and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not let go.
It seemed to him, by the end of the week,
that he had lived centuries, so far behind were the old life and outlook.
Passing through the City Hall Park,
he had noticed a group of men, in the centre of which were half a dozen, with flushed faces and raised voices, earnestly carrying on a discussion.
He heard hundreds of technical words that were new to him,
belonging to fields of thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon.
Because of this he could not follow the arguments closely,
and he could only guess at and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions.
Then there was a black eyed restaurant waiter who was a theosophist, a union baker who was an agnostic,
an old man who baffled all of them with the strange philosophy that _what is is right_,
and another old man who discoursed interminably about the cosmos and the father atom and the mother atom.
Martin Eden's head was in a state of addlement when he went away after several hours,
and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions of a dozen unusual words.
It was not that his brain was weak or incapable;
it could think these thoughts were it not for lack of training in thinking and lack of the thought tools with which to think.
He guessed this, and for a while entertained the idea ,
of reading nothing but the dictionary until he had mastered every word in it.
Poetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it,
finding his greatest joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable.
Poetry, like music, stirred him profoundly, and, though he did not know it,
he was preparing his mind for the heavier work that was to come.
The pages of his mind were blank, and, without effort, much he read and liked, stanza by stanza, was impressed upon those pages,
so that he was soon able to extract great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the beauty of the printed words he had read.
The man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that he had become quite cordial,
always greeting him with a smile and a nod when he entered.
was Ruth's reply over the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return the borrowed books,
;Come down any time; I'll be at home all afternoon,;
She felt the urge again of the desire to lean toward him for warmth,
and marvelled again at the effect his presence produced upon her.
She made it easy for him;
and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever.
He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made before,
and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in her.
Her pity could not be of the common sort,
when the man who drew it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind ,
and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings.
He marvelled at the wonder of it and the truth;
and as he gazed upon her he knew that he could die gladly upon a kiss.
They were lips of pure spirit,
and his desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire that had led him to other women's lips.
He could kiss her lips,
rest his own physical lips upon them,
but it would be with the lofty and awful fervor with which one would kiss the robe of God.
He was not conscious of this transvaluation of values that had taken place in him,
and was unaware that the light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light that shines in all men's eyes when the desire of love is upon them.
She was subtly perturbed by it, and more than once, though she knew not why,
it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly uttered.
Speech was always easy with her, and these interruptions would have puzzled her had she not decided that it was because he was a remarkable type.
She was very sensitive to impressions, and it was not strange, after all, that this aura of a traveller from another world should so affect her.
I've worked pretty hard ever since I was a kid,
an' since I've ben to the library, lookin' with new eyes at books an' lookin' at new books,
too I've just about concluded that I ain't ben reading the right kind.
Not that I'm any better than the sailors an' cow punchers I travelled with, I was cow punchin' for a short time, you know,
but I always liked books, read everything I could lay hands on, an'
I'd heard about such things an' read about such things in some of the books,
an' when I looked around at your house, why, the books come true.
But the thing I'm after is I liked it.
Here was a man who could do anything,
was the message she read there, and it accorded ill with the weakness of his spoken thought.
;Well ; She puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she thought,
while he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable.
;And you say 'ben' for 'been,'; she continued; ;'come' for 'came';
and the way you chop your endings is something dreadful.;
;Why, you said just now, to me, 'whiskey and beer anything that will make you drunk' make me drunk, don't you see?;
When she returned with the grammar,
she drew a chair near his he wondered if he should have helped her with the chair and sat down beside him.
He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do,
so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity.
It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies,
and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware.
The girls of the Lotus Club wondered what had become of him ,
and worried Jim with questions,
and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley's were glad that Martin came no more.
As the grammar had shown him the tie ribs of language,
so that book showed him the tie ribs of poetry,
and he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the beauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty.
Another modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art,
treated it exhaustively, with copious illustrations from the best in literature.
And his fresh mind, untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity of desire,
gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the student mind.
When he looked back now from his vantage ground, the old world he had known,
the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor men and harpy women, seemed a very small world;
and yet it blended in with this new world and expanded.
This led him to believe more firmly than ever that up above him,
in society like Ruth and her family, all men and women thought these thoughts and lived them.
Down below where he lived was the ignoble,
and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had soiled all his days,
and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt the upper classes.
All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a vague unrest;
he had never known what he wanted,
but he had wanted something that he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth.
He had seen too much of life, and his mind was too matured,
to be wholly content with fractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis;
and there were times when their conversation turned on other themes
the last poetry he had read, the latest poet she had studied.
Never, in all the women he had heard speak, had he heard a voice like hers.
The least sound of it was a stimulus to his love,
and he thrilled and throbbed with every word she uttered.
As he listened to her,
there rang in the ears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags,
and, in lesser degrees of harshness, the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his own class.
Then the chemistry of vision would begin to work,
and they would troop in review across his mind, each, by contrast, multiplying Ruth's glories.
Then, too, his bliss was heightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written thought.
She read to him much from ;The Princess,;
and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic nature strung.
and, as he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of life and reading its deepest secrets.
he decided that this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the world.
And in review would pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and burnings he had known,
the drunkenness of wine, the caresses of women, the rough play and give and take of physical contests,
and they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed.
she little knew that this rough sailor was creeping into her heart,
and storing there pent forces that would some day burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire.
Her knowledge of love was purely theoretical,
and she conceived of it as lambent flame, gentle as the fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water,
and cool as the velvet dark of summer nights.
Her idea of love was more that of placid affection,
serving the loved one softly in an atmosphere, flower scented and dim lighted, of ethereal calm.
The conjugal affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of love affinity,
and she looked forward some day to emerging, without shock or friction, into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a loved one.
So it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange individual,
and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects he produced upon her.
In similar ways she had experienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the menagerie,
or when she witnessed a storm of wind,
or shuddered at the bright ribbed lightning.
It was an unconscious impulse,
and farthest from her thoughts that her desire was to re thumb the clay of him into a likeness of her father's image,
which image she believed to be the finest in the world.
Nor was there any way, out of her inexperience,
for her to know that the cosmic feel she caught of him was that most cosmic of things,
love, which with equal power drew men and women together across the world,
compelled stags to kill each other in the rutting season, and drove even the elements irresistibly to unite.
She read Browning aloud to him,
and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages.
It was beyond her to realize that, out of his experience of men and women and life,
his interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers.
His conceptions seemed naive to her,
though she was often fired by his daring flights of comprehension,
whose orbit path was so wide among the stars that she could not follow ,
and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power.
His nature opened to music as a flower to the sun,
and the transition was quick from his working class rag time and jingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart.
from the exalted state this elevated him to,
he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow realm of spirit groping, where good and evil war eternally.
It was too wholly her, and he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice.
And he could not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill quaverings of factory girls,
ill nourished and untrained, and with the raucous shriekings from gin cracked throats of the women of the seaport towns.
In truth, it was the first time she had ever had a human soul to play with,
and the plastic clay of him was a delight to mould;
for she thought she was moulding it, and her intentions were good.
That first repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep.
She was studying hard at the university,
and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books ,
and have the fresh sea breeze of his personality blow upon her.
;There is Mr. Butler,; she said one afternoon, when grammar and arithmetic and poetry had been put aside.
He made it a point to save so much every week,
no matter what he had to do without in order to save it.
He wanted a career, not a livelihood,
and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his ultimate again.
;The food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the worst feedin' deep water ships,
than which there ain't much that can be possibly worse.;
;An' I bet,; Martin dashed on, ;that he's solemn an' serious as an old owl,
an' doesn't care a rap for a good time, for all his thirty thousand a year.
His sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the thousands of details of the boy's existence ,
and of his narrow spiritual development into a thirty thousand dollar a year man.
Why, thirty thousand, lump sum, wouldn't buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin' up would have bought him,
when he was a kid, in the way of candy an' peanuts or a seat in nigger heaven.;
It was true, his bizarre judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered,
but she ascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living, and they were soon forgotten.
Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them, the strength of their utterance,
and the flashing of eyes and earnestness of face that accompanied them,
she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw,
of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.
He studied book keeping and type writing,
and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice.
He refused the United States Senate several times,
and father says he could become a justice of the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to.
Thirty thousand a year was all right,
but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed such princely income of all its value.
Much of this he strove to express to Ruth,
and shocked her and made it clear that more remodelling was necessary.
Hers was that common insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color, creed,
and politics are best and right and that other human creatures scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they.
It was the same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God he was not born a woman,
and sent the modern missionary god substituting to the ends of the earth;
Not alone had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many weeks,
but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and reading.
He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates,
and made a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of speech.
A double negative jarred him like a discord,
and often, from lack of practice, it was from his own lips that the jar came.
After he had been through the grammar repeatedly,
he took up the dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary.
He found that this was no light task,
and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions,
while he invariably memorized himself to sleep.
;And; and ;ing,; with the ;d; and ;g; pronounced emphatically, he went over thousands of times;
and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more correct English than the officers themselves and the gentleman adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition.
The captain was a fishy eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into possession of a complete Shakespeare,
which he never read, and Martin had washed his clothes for him ,
and in return been permitted access to the precious volumes.
For a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without effort on his brain,
that all the world seemed to shape itself into forms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in blank verse.
He felt a sharp gradation between himself and his shipmates,
and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement.
The creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought ,
and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than Ruth.
The men of literature were the world's giants,
and he conceived them to be far finer than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year ,
and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.
There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world,
but he saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to master it.
Of course, he cautioned himself, it would be slow succeeding at first,
and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying.
He did not know how long an article he should write,
but he counted the words in a double page article in the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco Examiner, and guided himself by that.
he promptly set to work writing the article over,
referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric,
and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year.
he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners,
and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled,
and that they should be written on one side of the paper.
A man was a fool to go to sea when he could write,
he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him.
Its value was in the liberty it would get him,
the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer,
swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.
He had an idea that anything accepted by a paper was published immediately,
and as he had sent the manuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on the following Sunday.
He had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once
a voyage that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of six months.
While his imagination was fanciful, even fantastic at times,
he had a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about the things he knew.
He had completed on that day the first instalment of three thousand words
much to the amusement of Jim, and to the open derision of Mr. Higginbotham,
who sneered throughout meal time at the ;litery; person they had discovered in the family.
Martin contented himself by picturing his brother in law's surprise on Sunday morning,
when he opened his Examiner and saw the article on the treasure hunters.
Besides, there had not been any news value in his article,
and most likely the editor would write to him about it first.
The words flowed from his pen,
though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up definitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric.
He often read or re read a chapter at a time, during such pauses;
and he consoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he felt to be in him,
he was learning composition, at any rate, and training himself to shape up and express his thoughts.
He toiled on till dark,
when he went out to the reading room and explored magazines and weeklies until the place closed at ten o'clock.
Each day he did three thousand words,
and each evening he puzzled his way through the magazines,
taking note of the stories, articles, and poems that editors saw fit to publish.
He was cheered to read in Book News, in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers,
not that Rudyard Kipling received a dollar per word,
but that the minimum rate paid by first class magazines was two cents a word.
The Youth's Companion was certainly first class,
and at that rate the three thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty dollars two months' wages on the sea!
He planned to buy some more clothes,
to subscribe to many magazines,
and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library to consult.
He mailed the bulky manuscript to The Youth's Companion,
and on Saturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl diving, he went to see Ruth.
It seemed to enter into her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow,
and to set her quivering with its imparted strength.
He flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked into her blue eyes,
but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the flush, though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar.
In addition, his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat,
which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his appearance.
On the other hand, along with his ease of expression, he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her.
It was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a favorite in his own class,
but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her presence through lack of words and training.
But he was very tentative, fastidiously so,
letting Ruth set the pace of sprightliness and fancy, keeping up with her,
but never daring to go beyond her.
Now writers are so much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many more men who would like to write, who try to write.;
; he queried, secretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination,
;But then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?
throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a thousand other scenes from his life
scenes that were rough and raw, gross and bestial.
The whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light,
producing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train of thought.
He saw these other scenes through drifting vapors ,
and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish light.
He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey,
the air filled with obscenity and ribald language,
and he saw himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest,
or sitting at table with them, under smoking kerosene lamps,
while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards were dealt around.
He saw himself, stripped to the waist,
with naked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool Red in the forecastle of the Susquehanna;
and he saw the bloody deck of the John Rogers, that gray morning of attempted mutiny,
the mate kicking in death throes on the main hatch, the revolver in the old man's hand spitting fire and smoke,
the men with passion wrenched faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him
and then he returned to the central scene,
calm and clean in the steadfast light, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings; and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him;
and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words,
;But then, may I not be peculiarly constituted to write?;
;But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for blacksmithing,; she was laughing,
;I never heard of one becoming a blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.;
;And don't forget that I feel in me this capacity to write
I can't explain it; I just know that it is in me.;
; She looked at him, prettily puzzled,
for she did not quite like the persistence with which he clung to his notion.
He was clay in her hands immediately,
as passionately desirous of being moulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her ideal of man.
And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time,
that the entrance examinations to high school began on the following Monday,
he promptly volunteered that he would take them.
Then she played and sang to him,
while he gazed with hungry yearning at her,
drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be a hundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened and longed.
In his avoidance of slang and his search after right words,
Martin was compelled to talk slowly,
which enabled him to find the best thoughts that were in him.
He was more at ease than that first night at dinner, nearly a year before,
and his shyness and modesty even commended him to Mrs. Morse, who was pleased at his manifest improvement.
;I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,; was the answer.
;A very good thing,; he commented.
;But suppose, and we must suppose, sometimes, my dear,
suppose he arouses her interest too particularly in him?;
They were going out for a ride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels,
which did not interest Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was going along.
He did not ride, nor own a wheel,
but if Ruth rode, it was up to him to begin, was his decision;
and when he said good night, he stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel.
It was more than a month's hard earned wages,
and it reduced his stock of money amazingly;
but when he added the hundred dollars he was to receive from the Examiner to the four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least The Youth's Companion could pay him,
he felt that he had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused him.
Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fire escape to the rear wall of the building,
and when he had moved his bed out from the wall,
Sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school examination,
but the pearl diving article lured him away,
and he spent the day in the white hot fever of re creating the beauty and romance that burned in him.
The fact that the Examiner of that morning had failed to publish his treasure hunting article did not dash his spirits.
on Monday morning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school.
And when, days later, he applied for the results of his examinations, he learned that he had failed in everything save grammar.
;Your grammar is excellent,; Professor Hilton informed him, staring at him through heavy spectacles;
;but you know nothing, positively nothing, in the other branches, and your United States history is abominable
;Yes, sir,; Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that the man at the desk in the library was in Professor Hilton's place just then.
It would be a loss of time ;
he thought of her and his desire to have her ;and I can't afford the time.
I haven't the time to spare, in fact.;
It's all in the chart room,
and they know their way about in it,
and it's their business to show the place to strangers who might else get lost.
as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit spaces and
Dogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked,
but they were unable to tell what they saw that made them whine and bark.
He would stand up, with open eyes,
and he would struggle and toil and learn,
until with eyes unblinded and tongue untied, he could share with her his visioned wealth.
Other men had discovered the trick of expression, of making words obedient servitors,
and of making combinations of words mean more than the sum of their separate meanings.
He was stirred profoundly by the passing glimpse at the secret,
and he was again caught up in the vision of sunlit spaces and starry voids,
He was appalled by the vastness of the beauty that rightfully belonged in it,
and again his mind flashed and dared,
and he demanded of himself why he could not chant that beauty in noble verse as the great poets did.
It was the first time she had heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew,
and she was shocked,not merely as a matter of principle and training ,
but shocked in spirit by this rough blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood.
The placid poise of twenty four years without a single love affair did not fit her with a keen perception of her own feelings,
and she who had never warmed to actual love was unaware that she was warming now.
Rhyme and metre and structure were serious enough in themselves,
but there was, over and beyond them,
an intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great poetry,
but which he could not catch and imprison in his own.
It was the elusive spirit of poetry itself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture.
and weaving them into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty.
It was baffling He ached with desire to express and could ,
but gibber prosaically as everybody gibbered He read his fragments aloud.
The metre marched along on perfect feet,
and the rhyme pounded a longer and equally faultless rhythm,
but the glow and high exaltation that he felt within were lacking.
Following the ;Pearl diving,; he wrote an article on the sea as a career,
another on turtle catching, and a third on the northeast trades.
from morning till night, and late at night,
except when he broke off to go to the reading room, draw books from the library, or to call on Ruth.
The real world was in his mind,
and the stories he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his mind.
It was with regret that he ceased from writing to study, that he ceased from study to go to the library,
that he tore himself away from that chart room of knowledge or from the magazines in the reading room that were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded in selling their wares.
when he was with Ruth, to stand up and go;
and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time.
And, after he had explained the end,
which he thought he had made artistically obvious, she would say:
;That's what I wanted to know.
He took the laboratory proofs on faith,
and his intense power of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals more understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.
Levers and purchases fascinated him,
and his mind roved backward to hand spikes and blocks and tackles at sea.
The mysteries of storm, and rain, and tide were revealed,
and the reason for the existence of trade winds made him wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast trade too soon.
One afternoon he went out with Arthur to the University of California,
and, with bated breath and a feeling of religious awe,
went through the laboratories, saw demonstrations,
and listened to a physics professor lecturing to his classes.
A stream of short stories flowed from his pen,
and he branched out into the easier forms of verse
the kind he saw printed in the magazines
though he lost his head and wasted two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse,
the swift rejection of which, by half a dozen magazines, dumfounded him.
Then he discovered Henley and wrote a series of sea poems on the model of ;Hospital Sketches.
There were thirty, and he completed them in a month,
doing one a day after having done his regular day's work on fiction,
which day's work was the equivalent to a week's work of the average successful writer.
He was finding speech, and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent for years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild and virile flood.
; They were so beautiful to him that he was impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious,
far off time when he would dare to read to her what he had written.
Against that time he kept them with him,
reading them aloud, going over them until he knew them by heart.
He lived every moment of his waking hours,
and he lived in his sleep, his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease,
and combining the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels.
In reality, he never rested,
and a weaker body or a less firmly poised brain would have been prostrated in a general break down.
His late afternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now,
for June was approaching, when she would take her degree and finish with the university.
The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with that in which he lived,
and the mere nearness to her, sent him forth each time with a firmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights.
The world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of irresistible force;
what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived in it.
It was true, as he acquired knowledge and language, that he was drawing nearer,
talking her speech, discovering ideas and delights in common;
And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged for a moment,
and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever narrower.
They had been eating cherries great,
luscious, black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine And later, as she read aloud to him from ;The Princess,;
he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips.
Then he realized the significance of it,
and his heart began pounding and challenging him to play the lover with this woman ,
who was not a spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain.
He trembled at the audacity of his thought;
but all his soul was singing, and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.
Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion,
and as he looked into her frank eyes,
and knew that she had divined nothing of what he felt, he became abashed.
Early one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the beauty ,
and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain, Martin was called to the telephone.
Martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room,
and felt a wave of warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth's voice.
In his battle with the sonnet he had forgotten her existence,
and at the sound of her voice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow.
delicate and sweet, like a strain of music heard far off and faint,
or, better, like a bell of silver, a perfect tone, crystal pure.
He could scarcely hear what it said,
so ravished was he, though he controlled his face, for he knew that Mr. Higginbotham's ferret eyes were fixed upon him.
It was not much that Ruth wanted to say
merely that Norman had been going to take her to a lecture that night,
but that he had a headache, and she was so disappointed, and she had the tickets,
and that if he had no other engagement,
would he be good enough to take her?
Quite irrelevantly, still at the telephone and talking with her,
he felt an overpowering desire to die for her,
and visions of heroic sacrifice shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain.
In that moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him, go to a lecture with him with him,
Martin Eden she soared so far above him that there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her.
It was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes to all lovers,
and it came to him there, at the telephone, in a whirlwind of fire and glory;
and to die for her, he felt, was to have lived and loved well.
He did not look at him, and though his eyes passed over him, he did not see him;
and as in a dream he passed out of the room to dress.
On investigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard Higginbotham,
which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before.
As Ruth's front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with her,
he found himself greatly perturbed.
he wondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken,
or only between husbands and wives and relatives.
She had called him down the second time she walked out with him,
because he had gone along on the inside,
and she had laid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the outside when he was with a lady.
And Minnie had made a practice of kicking his heels, whenever they crossed from one side of the street to the other,
to remind him to get over on the outside.
For the first several times they walked freely,
side by side, and after that it was arms around the waists, and heads against the fellows' shoulders where the streets were unlighted.
He crooked the arm next to her
crooked it very slightly and with secret tentativeness, not invitingly,
, but just casually, as though he was accustomed to walk that way.
Delicious thrills ran through him at the contact,
and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the solid earth and was flying with her through the air.
Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and when he found himself on the inside,
he talked quickly and earnestly,
making a show of being carried away by what he was saying,
so that, in case he was wrong in not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.
She nodded and looked at him boldly, not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth's,
but with eyes that were handsome and hard,
and that swept on past him to Ruth and itemized her face and dress and station.
And he was aware that Ruth looked, too, with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove's, but which saw,
in a look that was a flutter on and past,
the working class girl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all working class girls were wearing just then.
If that girl had proper opportunity to dress, Mr. Eden,
and if she were taught how to carry herself, you would be fairly dazzled by her, and so would all men.;
When one's body is young, it is very pliable,
and hard work will mould it like putty according to the nature of the work.
She has had to take care of herself,
and a young girl can't take care of herself and keep her eyes soft and gentle like like yours, for example.;
And then he remembered that he loved her ,
and was lost in amazement at his fortune that permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture.
And yet you dare to open the books,
to listen to beautiful music,
to learn to love beautiful paintings,
to speak good English,
to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks,
to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys ,
and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars!
Then he got out note book and algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations,
while the hours slipped by, and the stars dimmed, and the gray of dawn flooded against his window.
Once or twice in the month, while riding through the park on his way to the library,
Martin dismounted from his wheel and listened to the arguments, and each time he tore himself away reluctantly.
These men, who slaughtered English, gesticulated like lunatics,
and fought one another's ideas with primitive anger,
seemed somehow to be more alive than Mr. Morse and his crony, Mr. Butler.
Martin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park,
but one afternoon a disciple of Spencer's appeared,
a seedy tramp with a dirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a shirt.
Battle royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes and the expectoration of much tobacco juice,
wherein the tramp successfully held his own,
even when a socialist workman sneered,
;There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.
; Martin was puzzled as to what the discussion was about,
but when he rode on to the library he carried with him a new born interest in Herbert Spencer,
and because of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned ;First Principles,; Martin drew out that volume.
Once before he had tried Spencer,
and choosing the ;Principles of Psychology; to begin with, he had failed as abjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky.
But this night, after algebra and physics,
and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed and opened ;First Principles.
He lay on the bed till his body grew tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on his back,
the book held in the air above him, or changing from side to side.
then the book tempted him and he fell, reading all afternoon,
oblivious to everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth gave to him.
His first consciousness of the immediate world about him was when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door,
and demanded to know if he thought they were running a restaurant.
He had merely skimmed over the surface of things, observing detached phenomena,
accumulating fragments of facts, making superficial little generalizations
and all and everything quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance.
The medieval metaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing,
and had served the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers.
He had understood nothing, and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry as dust theory,
of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible vocabularies.
And here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him,
reducing everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities,
, and presenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles.
It was in obedience to law that the bird flew,
and it was in obedience to the same law that fermenting slime had and squirmed and put out legs and wings and become a bird.
At night, asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare;
and awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist,
with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered.
At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things,
his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him.
In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun ,
and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away,
or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to cut the meat,
and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat,
until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his brain.
He was entranced by illumination, and did not hear the ;Bughouse,; whispered by Jim,
nor see the anxiety on his sister's face,
nor notice the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham's finger,
whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother in law's head.
But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous,
but that it was impossible for there to be no connection.
This new concept was a perpetual amazement to Martin,
and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun.
He drew up lists of the most incongruous things ,
and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all
kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions,
illuminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco.
Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it,
or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles,
not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal,
And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe,
and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.
some childish notions, a few half baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty,
a great black mass of ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance.
You wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese puzzle to you,
and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence.
It did not stir her deeply, as it did him,
and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him.
Arthur and Norman, he found, believed in evolution and had read Spencer,
though it did not seem to have made any vital impression upon them,
while the young fellow with the glasses and the mop of hair, Will Olney,
sneered disagreeably at Spencer and repeated the epigram,
;There is no god but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.;
Later, he was dumfounded to learn from various little happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth,
but that he had a positive dislike for her.
They rode out into the hills several Sundays on their wheels,
and Martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between Ruth and Olney.
Those Sundays were great days for Martin,
greatest because he was with Ruth, and great, also,
because they were putting him more on a par with the young men of her class.
he was finding himself their intellectual equal,
and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard.
while Mr. Butler stated that he had no patience with Spencer,
had never read a line of him,
and had managed to get along quite well without him.
As it was, he found Spencer's explanation of things convincing;
and, as he phrased it to himself,
to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a navigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard.
So Martin went on into a thorough study of evolution,
mastering more and more the subject himself,
and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand independent writers.
The more he studied, the more vistas he caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored,
and the regret that days were only twenty four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.
You can study French, or you can study German,
or cut them both out and study Esperanto,
you'll get the culture tone just the same.
Why, Ruth studied Saxon, became clever in it,
that was two years ago, and all that she remembers of it now is ,
'Whan that sweet Aprile with his schowers soote' isn't that the way it goes?;
Martin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that Olney was right,
he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded Ruth.
; Olney paused for effect, then added,
;And what they didn't tell us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin,
I'll have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will take care of the money my father's going to leave me.;
He knows more now about the world, and life, and man's place, and all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for that matter, and in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and culture.;
; Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression was malicious ;
I suppose you'll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her recommendation only you didn't.
It was about studies and lessons, dealing with the rudiments of knowledge,
and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with the big things that were stirring in him
with the grip upon life that was even then crooking his fingers like eagle's talons,
with the cosmic thrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness of mastery of it all.
He likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the shores of a strange land, filled with power of beauty,
stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric tongue of his brethren in the new land.
He was alive, painfully alive, to the great universal things,
and yet he was compelled to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should study Latin.
And his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well,
and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion when he was with Ruth.
He spent long hours in the free reading room,
going over what others had written,
studying their work eagerly and critically, comparing it with his own,
and wondering, wondering, about the secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.
Life was so strange and wonderful, filled with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils,
and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life.
He wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers,
the giants that fought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy,
making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor.
And not merely did he not know any writers,
but he did not know anybody who had ever attempted to write.
He folded them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript,
sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the mail box.
It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed.
but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps.
It was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies,
and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing gum or a tablet of chocolate.
These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received hundreds of them
as many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier manuscripts.
And he could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end, only mere cogs,
well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.
Each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction,
while the postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely.
At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she conceived to be his foolishness;
but now, out of sisterly solicitude, she grew anxious.
She had wanted him to devote himself to study,
and, though she had not openly disapproved of his writing, she had never approved.
She would not hand him a stereotyped rejection slip,
nor would she inform him that lack of preference for his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work.
She would talk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way,
and, most important of all, she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden.
It was the second time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along through the balmy warmth,
just chilled by she sea breeze to refreshing coolness,
he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very beautiful and well ordered world and that it was good to be alive and to love.
;It quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter,
fought the violent early spring, flowered, and lured the insects and the bees, scattered its seeds,
squared itself with its duty and the world, and ;
;But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical,
that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down off their beautiful wings.;
This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass,
and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass.
It is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech, written or spoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens,
transmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation.
I know song and laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; ,
and I see visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass,
I am sure, and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to,
just as you have succeeded with grammar.
He listened eagerly, with receptive ears, lying on his back,
and looking up and joying in each movement of her lips as she talked.
There was nothing alluring in the pictures she drew,
and he was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her.
In all she said there was no mention of his writing,
and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected on the ground.
At last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun,
measured its height above the horizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.
All the old fire and passion with which he had written it were reborn in him,
and he was swayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of it.
Her trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations, the overemphasis of the tyro,
and she was instantly aware each time the sentence rhythm tripped and faltered.
She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise,
except when it became too pompous, at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its amateurishness.
he had seen with his own eyes, grappled with his own brain,
and placed there on the page with his own hands in printed words.
He concealed his disappointment,
and joined so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down in him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement.
He was smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so innocent,
so penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to enter into him,
driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some ethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine.
But he knew life, its foulness as well as its fairness, its greatness in spite of the slime that infested it,
and by God he was going to have his say on it to the world.
To see moral grandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity;
to rise himself and first glimpse beauty, faint and far, through mud dripping eyes;
to see out of weakness, and frailty, and viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness, arising strength, and truth, and high spiritual endowment
He was impelled to suggest ;
Locksley Hall,; and would have done so, had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her, the female of his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment,
creeping and crawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries, had emerged on the topmost rung,
She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast upon him,
scarcely breathing, caught up and out of herself, he thought, by the witchery of the thing he had created.
it was the apotheosis of adventure
not of the adventure of the storybooks,
but of real adventure, the savage taskmaster, awful of punishment and awful of reward,
faithless and whimsical, demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and nights of toil,
offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of thirst and famine,
or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever, through blood and sweat ,
and stinging insects leading up by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements.
It was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story, and it was this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened.
Her eyes were wide, color was in her pale cheeks,
and before he finished it seemed to him that she was almost panting.
The paradox of it was that it was the story itself that was freighted with his power,
that was the channel, for the time being, through which his strength poured out to her.
She was aware only of the strength, and not of the medium,
and when she seemed most carried away by what he had written,
in reality she had been carried away by something quite foreign to it
by a thought, terrible and perilous, that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain.
She had caught herself wondering what marriage was like,
and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her.
She had never been tormented by womanhood, and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy,
dense even to the full significance of that delicate master's delicate allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and knights.
Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the bars into place,
while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in.
but there was something more than mere beauty in it,
something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden.
He heard her voice as from far off,
for he was debating whether he would read her the ;Sea Lyrics.
He lay in dull despair, while she watched him searchingly,
pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of marriage.
But she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that would at least be possible,
to ask what the ultimate something was which he had hinted at.
;I will be perfectly frank,; she promised, with an uneasy conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be quite frank with him the next time.
but looked about the mean little room and let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts,
still in their long envelopes, which lay in a corner on the floor.
He was a month's rent behind on the typewriter,
which he could not pay,
having barely enough for the week's board which was due and for the employment office fees.
It reminded him of his first fight, when he was six years old,
when he punched away with the tears running down his cheeks while the other boy, two years his elder,
had beaten and pounded him into exhaustion.
He saw the ring of boys, howling like barbarians as he went down at last, writhing in the throes of nausea,
as he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of fights which had followed.
there was another fight that was indeterminate,
because at quarter to four the door of the press room was thrown open and the gang of boys crowded in to fold their papers.
;I'll lick you to morrow,; he heard Cheese Face promise;
and he heard his own voice, piping and trembling with unshed tears, agreeing to be there on the morrow.
And he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there first,
and beating Cheese Face by two minutes.
The other boys said he was all right, and gave him advice,
pointing out his faults as a scrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their instructions.
His forearms were black and blue from wrist to elbow,
what of the countless blows he had warded off, and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester.
And so he dragged himself to the Enquirer alley, sick in body and soul,
but learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy,
Cheese Face, who was just as sick as he
, and just a bit willing to quit if it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful and necessary.
One afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not permit kicking,
striking below the belt, nor hitting when one was down,
Cheese Face, panting for breath and reeling, offered to call it quits.
when he tottered toward Cheese Face,
spitting out a mouthful of blood so that he could speak,
crying out that he would never quit,
though Cheese Face could give in if he wanted to.
When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained exquisitely, and the first few blows, struck and received, racked his soul;
after that things grew numb, and he fought on blindly,
seeing as in a dream, dancing and wavering, the large features and burning, animal like eyes of Cheese Face.
There was nothing else in the world but that face,
and he would never know rest, blessed rest, until he had beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles,
or until the bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him into a pulp.
;I'll meet you outside, after the last act,; Martin whispered,
the while his face showed undivided interest in the buck and wing dancing on the stage.
Between the acts he mustered his following
three fellows he knew from the nail works,
a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the Boo Gang,
along with as many more from the dread Eighteen and Market Gang.
Martin watched himself go into the centre, facing Cheese Face, and he heard himself say,
as he held up his hand warningly: ;They ain't no hand shakin' in this.
They sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss,
back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life,
striving blindly and chemically, as atoms strive, as the star dust if the heavens strives, colliding, recoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.
then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and the ghosts of the past possessed him,
and he was Martin Eden, just returned from sea and fighting Cheese Face on the Eighth Street Bridge.
Then he followed up a feint, right and left, was fiercely countered,
and felt his cheek laid open to the bone.
He watched and waited, until he feigned a wild rush,
which he stopped midway, for he had seen the glint of metal.
They fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion immeasurable and inconceivable,
until the crowd of brutes, its blood lust sated, terrified by what it saw, begged them impartially to cease.
Cheese Face, ready to drop and die, or to stay on his legs and die,
a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to Cheese Face had been beaten, wavered and hesitated;
but Martin sprang in and smashed him again and again.
Next, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese Face weakening fast,
in a mix up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin's right arm dropped to his side.
Dazed by the rapid succession of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and earnest curses sobbed out ,
and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair.
He punched on, with his left hand only,
and as he punched, doggedly, only half conscious,
as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear in the gangs, and one who said with shaking voice: ;This ain't a scrap, fellows.
he was glad, punching on wearily and endlessly with his one arm,
battering away at a bloody something before him that was not a face,
but a horror, an oscillating, hideous, gibbering, nameless thing that persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away.
And he punched on and on, slower and slower, as the last shreds of vitality oozed from him,
through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses of time, until, in a dim way,
he became aware that the nameless thing was sinking,
slowly sinking down to the rough board planking of the bridge.
And the next moment he was standing over it,
staggering and swaying on shaky legs, clutching at the air for support,
and saying in a voice he did not recognize: ;D'ye want any more?
He was still saying it, over and over, demanding, entreating, threatening, to know if it wanted any more,
when he felt the fellows of his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying to put his coat on him.
Then, like one from the dead,
he sprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring down his face, shouting:
;I licked you, Cheese Face!
he was aware of the present, of the books he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages,
of his dreams and ambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl, sensitive and sheltered and ethereal,
who would die of horror did she witness but one moment of what he had just lived through
one moment of all the muck of life through which he had waded.
;And you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness,
and thrust your shoulders among the stars,
doing what all life has done, letting the 'ape and tiger die',
and wresting highest heritage from all powers that be.;
He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of,
and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head,
and ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.
; ;Joy,; his latest born, completed the day before and tossed into the corner for lack of stamps, won his keenest approbation.
was interrupted by a new comer, dressed rather foppishly,
as some workingmen dress who have instincts for finer things.
and Martin, staring back, noted the puffed and discolored face,
handsome and weak, and knew that he had been making a night of it.
;Hard labor, sailorizing, run a type writer, no shorthand, can sit on a horse, willing to do anything and tackle anything,; was the answer.
The room was situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the engine that pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry machinery.
The engineer, who occupied the adjoining room,
dropped in to meet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb,
on an extension wire, so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over the table to the bed.
So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly as they, and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door.
Martin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes,
while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft soap,
compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth and nostrils and eyes in bath towels till he resembled a mummy.
This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute,
tearing the matter from the clothes by centrifugal force.
Then Martin began to alternate between the dryer and the wringer, between times ;shaking out; socks and stockings.
after supper they worked until ten o'clock,
under the blazing electric lights,
until the last piece of under clothing was ironed and folded away in the distributing room.
It was a hot California night, and though the windows were thrown wide,
the room, with its red hot ironing stove, was a furnace.
He was surprised at his weariness when he act into his room,
forgetful of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for fourteen hours.
He concentrated himself upon his work and upon how to save time,
pointing out to Martin where he did in five motions what could be done in three,
or in three motions what could be done in two.
He was a good workman himself, quick and deft,
and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man should do any of his work for him or outwork him.
He ;rubbed out; collars and cuffs,
rubbing the starch out from between the double thicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to the ironing,
and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe's praise.
They starched two hundred white shirts,
with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands,
neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand.
At the same moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not enter the starch,
and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water.
He slept seven hours of heavy, animal like sleep,
and awoke by the alarm, feeling that he had not had enough.
Martin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with strong soft soap,
by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a plunger pole that was attached to a spring pole overhead.
;Beats a washboard an' your knuckles, and, besides,
it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week, an
' fifteen minutes ain't to be sneezed at in this shebang.;
He was too tired and jaded to be interested in anything,
though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon, if they finished at three, and ride on his wheel to Oakland.
It would have been easier to go on the train,
but the round trip was two dollars and a half, and he was intent on saving money.
By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband,
setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom.
As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and ;backed; them.
An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe and Martin, and such test was useless.
They went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks,
gauging the heat by some secret mental process that Martin admired but could not understand.
A fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost,
and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed
an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that were machine like and unerring.
Ceaselessly active, head and hand, an intelligent machine,
all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that intelligence.
He drank enormous quantities of water,
but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores.
So Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension, though nervous tension rose higher than ever,
and he listened sympathetically to the other's blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over the beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do their own laundrying.
Saturday morning it was ;fancy starch,; and odds and ends, and at three in the afternoon the week's work was done.
Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds and minutes all week,
circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles,
a fount of resistless energy, a high driven human motor, a demon for work,
now that he had accomplished the week's task he was in a state of collapse.
Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin decided,
but the half mile walk down to the village to find out seemed a long journey to him.
He was too tired to feel sleepy,
and he lay, scarcely thinking, in a semi stupor of weariness, until it was time for supper.
Joe did not appear for that function,
and when Martin heard the gardener remark that most likely he was ripping the slats off the bar, Martin understood.
and Monday morning he was hard at work,
sorting clothes, while Joe, a towel bound tightly around his head,
with groans and blasphemies, was running the washer and mixing soft soap.
Another week passed, a great battle that continued under the electric lights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three o'clock,
when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted down to the village to forget.
He slept in the shade of the trees,
toiled aimlessly through the newspaper,
and spent long hours lying on his back, doing nothing, thinking nothing.
He saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting down through the green leaves,
A black screen was drawn across his mirror of inner vision,
and fancy lay in a darkened sick room where entered no ray of light.
his brain gnawing with maggots, exulting in maudlin ways over maudlin things,
fantastically and gloriously drunk and forgetful of Monday morning and the week of deadening toil to come.
His audacities of phrase struck him as grotesque,
his felicities of expression were monstrosities, and everything was absurd, unreal, and impossible.
But Saturday afternoon, after work was finished ,
and he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him.
;I guess I'll go down and see how Joe's getting on,; was the way he put it to himself;
and in the same moment he knew that he lied.
Martin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and awing the barkeeper,
an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and hair parted in the middle.
He tried to tell it to Joe,
but Joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes whereby he would escape the slavery of laundry work and become himself the owner of a great steam laundry.
But Martin turned away, leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper,
until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who, coming in, accepted Martin's invitation.
Martin dispensed royal largess, inviting everybody up, farm hands, a stableman,
and the gardener's assistant from the hotel, the barkeeper,
and the furtive hobo who slid in like a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end of the bar.
They fought late each night under the electric lights,
bolted their meals, and even got in a half hour's work before breakfast.
Every moment was drive, drive, drive,
and Joe was the masterful shepherd of moments,
herding them carefully, never losing one,
counting them over like a miser counting gold,
working on in a frenzy, toil mad, a feverish machine, aided ably by that other machine that thought of itself as once having been one Martin Eden, a man.
In a short while, or maybe after a thousand years or so,
he would awake, in his little room with the ink stained table,
and take up his writing where he had left off the day before.
when he would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck,
under the tropic stars, and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing through his flesh.
;Guess I'll go down an' get a glass of beer,; Joe said, in the queer, monotonous tones that marked his week end collapse.
Joe was halfway down to the saloon when Martin passed by,
bending low over the handle bars, his legs driving the ninety six gear with rhythmic strength,
his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust.
A fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled as a machine, with just a spark of something more in him,
just a glimmering bit of soul, that compelled him, at each week end, to scorch off the hundred and forty miles.
At the end of the seventh week, without intending it, too weak to resist,
he drifted down to the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday morning.
Again, at the week ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles,
obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still greater exertion.
He called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around,
and while they drank his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.
He held on to the bar, his legs wobbling under him,
Martin's arm around him and supporting him, while he thought.
While Martin changed the telegram to ;two laundrymen,;
Joe went on: ;I never wanted to drink when I was in hospital.
They shook hands, and Joe held on to his for a moment, as he said:
;I'm goin' to see you again, Mart, before you an' me die.
Then he plodded down the road himself, to the water tank,
where half a dozen empties lay on a side track waiting for the up freight.
Having gained her degree, she was doing no more studying;
and he, having worked all vitality out of his mind and body, was doing no writing.
Then he began to read again light novels, and poetry;
and after several days more he was head over heels in his long neglected Fiske.
It would have been easy for him to get out of it;
but his natural impulse was for frankness,
and he remembered his old resolve to be frank, no matter what happened.
She was silent, unsympathetic, and he watched her moodily,
realizing how impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through.
It pointed out to her how near she had drawn to him,
and once accepted, it paved the way for greater intimacy.
And all this affected her as a very noble state of consciousness;
nor did she dream that behind it and underlying it were the jealousy and desire of love.
They rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather,
and out in the hills they read poetry aloud,
now one and now the other, noble, uplifting poetry that turned one's thoughts to higher things.
Renunciation, sacrifice, patience, industry, and high endeavor were the principles she thus indirectly preached
such abstractions being objectified in her mind by her father, and Mr. Butler, and by Andrew Carnegie,
who, from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the book giver of the world.
And he caught glimpses of their life, in the years to come,
wherein, against a background of work and comfort and general well being, he saw himself,
But alwaysand in the background that was beyond the background of nature, dim and hazy,
were work and success and money earned that made them free of the world and all its treasures.
Ruth was blushing,
but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for the first time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held equally sacred.
Sometimes I am positively in terror of him,
when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he has done as if they did not matter.
They sat with their arms twined around each other,
and in the pause her mother patted her hand and waited for her to go on.
He swears, he smokes, he drinks,
he has fought with his fists he has told me so, and he likes it; he says so .
I feel that I must be nasty to him,
and even when I don't happen to feel that way, why, he's nasty to me, anyway.
No one ever loved me before no man, I mean, in that way.
It is sweet to feel that you are really and truly a woman.
; She buried her face in her mother's lap, sobbing.
;You think I am dreadful, I know, but I am honest, and I tell you just how I feel.;
Her child daughter, who was a bachelor of arts, was gone;
but in her place was a woman daughter.
This rough sailor fellow had been the instrument,
and, though Ruth did not love him, he had made her conscious of her womanhood.
And it makes me feel grown up, the thought of it, the very thought of it;
and I feel that I am possessed of something that is by rights my own
that makes me like the other girls and and young women.
You thought you did not let me know that dear worry of yours,
but I did, and I wanted to 'to make good,' as Martin Eden says.;
It was a holy hour for mother and daughter,
and their eyes were wet as they talked on in the twilight,
Ruth all white innocence and frankness, her mother sympathetic, receptive, yet calmly explaining and guiding.
Loving you, he should, in the name of common sense, be doing something that would give him the right to marry,
instead of paltering around with those stories of his and with childish dreams.
You will find one some day, and you will love him and be loved by him,
and you will be happy with him as your father and I have been happy with each other.
;I have thought about them,; Ruth confessed, remembering the wanton thoughts that had vexed her in the past,
her face again red with maiden shame that she should be telling such things.
Ruth pressed her mother's hand in assent, feeling that she really did understand,
though her conception was of something vague, remote, and terrible that was beyond the scope of imagination.
; she cried exultantly, as they stood up, catching her mother's hands and standing erect,
facing her in the twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them.
;I should never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk.
I had to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one, too.;
;We are women together,; she repeated, as they went out of the room,
their arms around each other's waists, their hearts swelling with a new sense of companionship.
And, besides, a year in the East, with the change in climate, people, ideas, and everything, is just the thing she needs.;
Stories and poems were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain,
and he made notes of them against the future time when he would give them expression.
he had resolved to devote it to rest and love,
and in both matters he prospered He was soon spilling over with vitality,
He had liked women in that turgid past of his, and been fascinated by some of them,
but he had not known what it was to love them.
In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on through the ever changing phases of it,
he had learned a rule of conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game,
he should let the other fellow play first.
she consciously delighted in beholding his love manifestations
the glowing eyes with their tender lights, the trembling hands,
and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn.
She even went farther, in a timid way inciting him,
but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and doing it half consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself.
She thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman,
and she took an Eve like delight in tormenting him and playing upon him.
Tongue tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly and awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact.
but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills,
and in conning the pages of books side by side,
there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand.
And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder,
as they leaned together over the beauty of the books.
She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly,
when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs.
and, usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him ,
and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love.
To rest his head in a girl's lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now,
and now he found Ruth's lap inaccessible and impossible.
Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him,
while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.
Once he dared, one afternoon, when he found her in the darkened living room with a blinding headache.
Life poured from the ends of his fingers,
driving the pain before it, or so it seemed to her,
until with the easement of pain, she fell asleep and he stole away.
He was warm, and bungling of speech, and very happy, as he replied to her, and there was dancing in his mind,
throughout the telephone conversation, the memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett.
What had been done could be done again,
and he, Martin Eden, could do it and would do it for Ruth Morse.
The sonnet he composed that night was the first of a love cycle of fifty sonnets which was completed within two months.
He had the ;Love sonnets from the Portuguese;
in mind as he wrote, and he wrote under the best conditions for great work, at a climacteric of living, in the throes of his own sweet love madness.
It was a week after he cured her headache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman and seconded by Arthur and Olney.
The moon had not yet risen,
and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault of the sky and exchanging no speech with Martin,
experienced a sudden feeling of loneliness.
A puff of wind was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash,
and he, one hand on tiller and the other on main sheet,
was luffing slightly, at the same time peering ahead to make out the near lying north shore.
He was unaware of her gaze, and she watched him intently,
speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him, a young man with signal powers,
to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure.
Her eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight,
and over the firm poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon his neck came back to her.
Her position on the heeling boat irked her,
and she remembered the headache he had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him.
Then arose in her the impulse to lean against him, to rest herself against his strength
a vague, half formed impulse, which, even as she considered it, mastered her and made her lean toward him.
She leaned lightly against his shoulder, but she leaned,
and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to make it more comfortable for her.
She was no longer herself but a woman, with a woman's clinging need;
and though she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied.
She was no longer tired.
But he luffed the boat less delicately,
spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore.
stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers,
and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible,
giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.
When the first light of the rising moon touched the sail,
illuminating the boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him.
And, even as she moved,
She stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack,
and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful thing.
She entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were alone together, of lying to him,
of mentioning casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up.
Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing moon,
and she knew he would know it for a lie.
In the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a strange, puzzling creature,
wilful over judgment and scornful of self analysis, refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither she was drifting.
Of course, it would be a painful half hour for him, and an embarrassing half hour for her,
The fabric of her life, of all that constituted her, quivered and grew tremulous.
The thought fluttered in her mind like a flame attracted moth.
She went so far as to imagine Martin proposing, herself putting the words into his mouth;
and she rehearsed her refusal, tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood.
Came a beautiful fall day, warm and languid,
palpitant with the hush of the changing season,
a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun and wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air.
The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten metal,
whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy tide.
bulked hugely by the Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering sun.
Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky line tumbled cloud masses that swept landward,
giving warning of the first blustering breath of winter.
Yet summer lingered, fading and fainting among her hills,
deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures,
dying with the calm content of having lived and lived well.
And among the hills, on their favorite knoll,
Martin and Ruth sat side by side, their heads bent over the same pages,
he reading aloud from the love sonnets of the woman who had loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved.
The golden year was dying as it had lived,
a beautiful and unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content freighted heavily the air.
It entered into them, dreamy and languorous, weakening the fibres of resolution,
suffusing the face of morality, or of judgment, with haze and purple mist.
His head was very near to hers, and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his face,
the printed pages swam before his eyes.
;It will be our last in the hills for some time,; he announced gravely.
;There's a storm gathering out there on the sea rim.;
The book slipped from his hands to the ground,
and they sat idly and silently,
gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did not see.
She waited, she knew not for what, panting,
with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever of expectancy in all her blood.
And a moment later, tearing herself half out of his embrace,
suddenly and exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon Martin Eden's sunburnt neck.
So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan,
relaxed her hands, and lay half swooning in his arms.
; She was speaking very slowly, her eyes warm and fluttery and melting,
a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go away.
;I don't know,; he laughed, ;unless just by loving you,
for I loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone, much less the heart of the living, breathing woman you are.;
; She was looking into his eyes at the moment,
but her own dropped as she continued, ;You see, I didn't know what this was like.;
He offered to draw her toward him again,
but it was no more than a tentative muscular movement of the girdling arm,
for he feared that he might be greedy.
He felt like assuring her that mothers' hearts were not so easily broken,
but instead he said, ;And love is the greatest thing in the world.;
And we are fortunate above most, for we have found our first love in each other.
; ;But that is impossible! ; she cried, withdrawing herself from his arms with a swift, passionate movement.
And to Martin Eden's supreme surprise,
she burst into a storm of tears that took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away.
And all the while there was running through his head Kipling's line: ;_
And the Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under their skins_. ;
It was all right enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win each other by contact;
but for the exalted personages up above on the heights to make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable.
The same pressures and caresses, unaccompanied by speech, that were efficacious with the girls of the working class, were equally efficacious with the girls above the working class.
They were all of the same flesh, after all, sisters under their skins;
As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her,
he took great consolation in the thought that the Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady were pretty much alike under their skins.
;Besides, I am older than you,; she remarked suddenly, opening her eyes and looking up at him, ;three years older.;
In truth, they were children together, so far as love was concerned,
and they were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as a pair of children,
and this despite the fact that she was crammed with a university education and that his head was full of scientific philosophy and the hard facts of life.
They sat on through the passing glory of the day,
talking as lovers are prone to talk,
marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had flung them so strangely together,
and dogmatically believing that they loved to a degree never attained by lovers before.
they returned insistently, again and again, to a rehearsal of their first impressions of each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely what they felt for each other and how much there was of it.
The cloud masses on the western horizon received the descending sun, and the circle of the sky turned to rose,
while the zenith glowed with the same warm color.
The rosy light was all about them, flooding over them, as she sang, ;Good by, Sweet Day.
Mrs. Morse did not require a mother's intuition to read the advertisement in Ruth's face when she returned home.
The flush that would not leave the cheeks told the simple story,
and more eloquently did the eyes, large and bright, reflecting an unmistakable inward glory.
But I couldn't help it.
I did not dream that I loved him until that moment.
And you must tell father for me.;
Our plans go no farther than your marrying some man in your own station in life,
a good and honorable gentleman, whom you will select yourself, when you love him.;
;We would not influence your choice in any way;
but you are our daughter, and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as this.
but comfort is another matter,
and our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her that
and not a penniless adventurer, a sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler,
and Heaven knows what else, who, in addition to everything, is hare brained and irresponsible.;
I never thought to love him, but, you see, I do,;
she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.
Here was this sailor fellow, the only accessible man at the moment,
and of course she promptly loved him, or thought she did, which amounts to the same thing.;
Young women and young men, all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have done something ,
or who are doing things, men of her own class, gentlemen, She can gauge him by them.
Martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman, and went on:
;I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to the editors again.
;A position! ; she cried, betraying the gladness of her surprise in all her body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling.
Also, I've been reading Spencer's 'Philosophy of Style,'
and found out a lot of what was the matter with me or my writing, rather;
and for that matter with most of the writing that is published every month in the magazines.;
I shall leave masterpieces alone and do hack work jokes, paragraphs, feature articles,
humorous verse, and society verse all the rot for which there seems so much demand.
When I first tried to write, I had nothing to write about except a few paltry experiences which I neither understood nor appreciated.
That was when I began to do good work,
when I wrote 'Adventure,' 'Joy,' 'The Pot,' 'The Wine of Life,' 'The Jostling Street,' the 'Love cycle,' and the 'Sea Lyrics. '
and just as I was going to bed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet a humorous one;
and inside an hour I had written four.
And furthermore, the hack work keeps me in touch with things literary and gives me time to try bigger things.;
,; he asserted stoutly, putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive sweetheart toward him,
;Then we'll get married on triolets that will sell,
But to save me I can't see any difference between writing jokes ,
or comic verse and running a type writer, taking dictation, or keeping sets of books.
It is all a means to an end, Your theory is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful lawyer or man of business.
I want the best of everything in the world for you,
and the only time when I won't want it will be when there is something better.
I had thought, and I still think, that the best thing for you would be to study shorthand
you already know type writing and go into father's office.
In the breathing spell of the vacation he had taken, he had spent many hours in self analysis,
and thereby learned much of himself.
He wanted to be great in the world's eyes;
;to make good,; as he expressed it,
in order that the woman he loved should be proud of him and deem him worthy.
In spite of every advantage of university training,
and in the face of her bachelorship of arts, his power of intellect overshadowed hers,
and his year or so of self study and equipment gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world and art and life that she could never hope to possess.
but by a refined process of the same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that the human organism achieved its highest purpose in love,
that love must not be questioned, but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life.
Thus, he considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and it was a delight to him to think of ;God's own mad lover,;
rising above the things of earth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and applause, rising above life itself and ;dying on a kiss.;
In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation except when he went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan.
a virago and a widow, hard working and harsher tempered,
rearing her large brood of children somehow,
and drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin, sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen cents.
She cooked, and all ate,
in the kitchen, where she likewise washed, starched, and ironed clothes on all days of the week except Sunday;
for her income came largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors.
Remained the bedroom, small as the one occupied by Martin,
into which she and her seven little ones crowded and slept.
It was an everlasting miracle to Martin how it was accomplished,
and from her side of the thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going to bed,
the squalls and squabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy, twittering noises as of birds.
Another source of income to Maria were her cows, two of them,
which she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the public side walks,
attended always by one or more of her ragged boys,
whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their eyes out for the poundmen.
Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type writing stand.
The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau,
manufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which was shed day by day.
This bureau stood in the corner, and in the opposite corner, on the table's other flank, was the kitchen
the oil stove on a dry goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils,
a shelf on the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on the floor.
Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there being no tap in his room.
On days when there was much steam to his cooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous.
but the tribe of Silva, loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out.
Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night long.
Hand in hand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes,
and so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clothes lines across the room on which the notes were hung.
To go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without collisions.
With a sudden twitch and lurch, he terminated the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal,
one bank of which was the bed, the other the table.
When the chair was not in use, it reposed on top of the bed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking,
reading a book while the water boiled,
and even becoming skilful enough to manage a aragraph or two while steak was frying.
Also, so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen,
he was able, sitting down, to reach anything he needed.
Pea soup was a common article in his diet, as well as potatoes and beans,
the latter large and brown and cooked in Mexican style.
Dried fruits were less expensive than fresh,
and he had usually a pot of them, cooked and ready at hand, for they took the place of butter on his bread.
he was so far from his market that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first returns from his hack work.
Except at such times as he saw Ruth, or dropped in to see his sister Gertude, he lived a recluse,
in each day accomplishing at least three days' labor of ordinary men.
He slept a scant five hours,
and only one with a constitution of iron could have held himself down, as Martin did, day after day, to nineteen consecutive hours of toil.
Every strange or partly familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down,
and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed and pinned to the wall or looking glass.
Reading the works of men who had arrived,
he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the tricks by which they had been achieved
the tricks of narrative, of exposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams;
He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms,
till out of many such, culled from many writers, he was able to induce the general principle of mannerism,
and, thus equipped, to cast about for new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and appraise them properly.
In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases, the phrases of living language,
phrases that bit like acid and scorched like flame,
or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of common speech.
He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory,
where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe;
and, having dissected and learned the anatomy of beauty, he was nearer being able to create beauty itself.
He could not work blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be right and fine.
His was deliberate creative genius, and, before he began a story or poem,
the thing itself was already alive in his brain,
with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in his conscious possession.
On the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain,
and that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable connotations.
Before such he bowed down and marvelled,
knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man.
And no matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty possible,
he was aware, always, of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated.
He knew full well, from his Spencer, that man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything,
and that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of life
nay, more that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted,
and that he himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine and star dust and wonder.
In fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay entitled ;Star dust,;
in which he had his fling, not at the principles of criticism, but at the principal critics.
It was a habit he developed, of incubating and maturing his thought upon a subject, and of then rushing into the type writer with it.
The writing of it was the culminating act of a long mental process,
the drawing together of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data with which his mind was burdened.
It was in a way akin to that common habit of men and women troubled by real or fancied grievances,
who periodically and volubly break their long suffering silence and ;have their say;
till the last word is said.
Caught in the pinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots,
rice and apricots was his menu three times a day for five days hand running.
The Portuguese grocer, to whom he had hitherto paid cash, called a halt when Martin's bill reached the magnificent total of three dollars and eighty five cents.
then, to show that it was purely business foresight and not prejudice,
;Hava da drink on da house good friends justa da same.;
The fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables,
was run by an American whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run a bill of five dollars before stopping his credit.
An occasional dinner at Ruth's helped to keep strength in his body,
though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping when his appetite was raging at sight of so much food spread before it.
Now and again, though afflicted with secret shame, he dropped in at his sister's at meal time and ate as much as he dared
more than he dared at the Morse table.
He could not hope for a meal at Ruth's, for she was away to San Rafael on a two weeks' visit;
and for very shame's sake he could not go to his sister's.
Then it was tha Martin wore his overcoat down into Oakland,
and came back without it, but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket.
He paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen,
and in his kitchen fried steak and onions, made coffee, and stewed a large pot of prunes.
Later on he pawned his watch,
and still later his wheel, reducing the amount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and sending them out.
He compared it with what he found in the newspapers, weeklies, and cheap magazines,
and decided that his was better, far better, than the average; yet it would not sell.
Then he discovered that most of the newspapers printed a great deal of what was called ;plate; stuff,
and he got the address of the association that furnished it.
His own work that he sent in was returned,
along with a stereotyped slip informing him that the staff supplied all the copy that was needed.
And yet, from day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies,
scores and scores of storiettes, not one of which would compare with his.
In his despondency, he concluded that he had no judgment whatever, that he was hypnotized by what he wrote, and that he was a self deluded pretender.
He folded the stamps in with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter box,
and from three weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and handed him the manuscript.
He had never received a sign of the existence of one, and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he wrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths, manufactured and maintained by office boys, typesetters, and pressmen.
He was afflicted always with a gnawing restlessness, more tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed her love;
for now that he did possess her love, the possession of her was far away as ever.
This man, whose clay was so plastic that he could live in any number of pigeonholes of human existence,
she thought wilful and most obstinate because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole, which was the only one she knew.
he told her once, in a discussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater,
;You worship at the shrine of the established,;
They are weak minded, and the established impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of the brewery is impressed on a beer bottle.
And their function is to catch all the young fellows attending the university,
to drive out of their minds any glimmering originality that may chance to be there, and to put upon them the stamp of the established.;
;I think I am nearer the truth,; she replied, ;when I stand by the established, than you are, raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea Islander.;
;And unfortunately, all the missionaries are off among the heathen, so there are none left at home to break those old images, Mr. Vanderwater and Mr. Praps.;
She could not help but measure the professors, neat, scholarly, in fitting clothes, speaking in well modulated voices,
breathing of culture and refinement, with this almost indescribable young fellow whom somehow she loved,
whose clothes never would fit him,
whose heavy muscles told of damning toil,
who grew excited when he talked, substituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance for cool self possession.
he who had stood, so short a time before, in that same living room,
blushing and awkward, acknowledging his introduction,
looking fearfully about him at the bric a brac his swinging shoulders threatened to break,
asking how long since Swinburne died,
and boastfully announcing that he had read ;Excelsior; and the ;Psalm of Life.;
He did not love her for what she thought of Praps and Vanderwater and English professors,
and he was coming to realize,
with increasing conviction, that he possessed brain areas and stretches of knowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed.
It was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month's rigid economizing on food.
After vainly waiting for him to speak about it,
herself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and heard, she had asked the question.
I'd give anything to hear them in concert,
and I'd give even a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing.
To hear Barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel,
and to hear Tetralani reply like another angel,
and to hear it all accompanied by a perfect orgy of glowing and colorful music is ravishing, most ravishing.
But the whole effect is spoiled when I look at them at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking feet and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds,
and at Barillo, a scant five feet four, greasy featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized blacksmith,
at the pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their breasts, flinging their arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum;
when I am expected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a love scene between a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome, romantic, young prince why, I can't accept it,
;In painting there are only two dimensions to the canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three dimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the canvas.
You accept as perfectly legitimate the author's account of the secret thoughts of the heroine,
and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when thinking these thoughts,
Nor would you, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics to night as a convincing portrayal of love.;
there is no reason under the sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of my fellow creatures like it, or make believe they like it.
If I had, I could have wept sentimental tears to night,
and the clownish antics of that precious pair would have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty of the accompanying orchestra.
An illusion that won't convince is a palpable lie,
and that's what grand opera is to me when little Barillo throws a fit, clutches mighty Tetralani in his arms also in a fit , and tells her how passionately he adores her.;
She had always been used to music,
and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was a child,,
and all her world had enjoyed it, too.
At the best, in her most charitable frame of mind, she considered the statement of his views to be a caprice, an erratic and uncalled for prank.
later, on a sleepless pillow, she puzzled, as she had often puzzled of late,
as to how it was that she loved so strange a man, and loved him despite the disapproval of her people.
And next day Martin Eden cast hack work aside, and at white heat hammered out an essay to which he gave the title, ;The Philosophy of Illusion.
A stamp started it on its travels, but it was destined to receive many stamps and to be started on many travels in the months that followed.
Also, while aware that poverty was anything but delectable, she had a comfortable middle class feeling that poverty was salutary,
that it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not degraded and hopeless drudges.
So that her knowledge that Martin was so poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her.
She even considered it the hopeful side of the situation,
believing that sooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his writing.
Sometimes, when with her, she noted an unusual brightness in his eyes,
and she admired it, for it made him appear more the poet and the scholar
the things he would have liked to be and which she would have liked him to be.
But Maria Silva read a different tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes,
and she noted the changes in them from day to day, by them following the ebb and flow of his fortunes.
She saw him leave the house with his overcoat and return without it,
though the day was chill and raw, and promptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger leave his eyes.
In the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go,
and after each event she had seen his vigor bloom again.
On occasion, in a casual sort of way, when she thought hunger pinched hardest,
she would send him in a loaf of new baking, awkwardly covering the act with banter to the effect that it was better than he could bake.
again, she would send one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup,
debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from the mouths of her own flesh and blood.
On a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house,
Maria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine.
Utterly differentiated creatures that they were, they were lonely in their misery,
and though the misery was tacitly ignored, it was the bond that drew them together.
Maria was amazed to learn that he had been in the Azores, where she had lived until she was eleven.
But her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he had been on Maui,
the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood and married.
Then he studied the deep lined face of the toil worn woman before him,
remembered her soups and loaves of new baking,
and felt spring up in him the warmest gratitude and philanthropy.
;Well, den ; She drew a big breath like a child, as she voiced to the uttermost all she cared to demand of life.
There will be chickens, pigs, vegetables, fruit trees, and everything like that;
and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two.
He had no second best suit that was presentable,
and though he could go to the butcher and the baker,
and even on occasion to his sister's,
In desperation, all but ready to surrender, to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh start,
hetook the civil service examinations for the Railway Mail.
He staggered into his room and sat down on the bed,
the envelope still unopened, and in that moment came understanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of extraordinarily good news.
And finally to be added, his pledges, plus interest, with the pawnbroker watch, $5. 50;
He read the letter, skimming it line by line,
dashing through the editor's praise of his story to the meat of the letter,
the statement why the check had not been sent.
He went back to the day he first attempted to write,
and was appalled at the enormous waste of time
and all for ten words for a cent.
The Transcontinental sold for twenty five cents,
and its dignified and artistic cover proclaimed it as among the first class magazines.
Why, on the outside cover were printed every month the words of one of the world's great writers,
words proclaiming the inspired mission of the Transcontinental by a star of literature whose first coruscations had appeared inside those self same covers.
The great writer had recently died in a foreign land in dire poverty, Martin remembered,
which was not to be wondered at, considering the magnificent pay authors receive.
Well, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and their pay,
and he had wasted two years over it.
But then, Joe was not in love, had none of the responsibilities of love,
, and he could afford to loaf through the land of nothing to do.
The disappointment of it, the lie of it, the infamy of it, were uppermost in his thoughts;
and under his closed eyelids, in fiery figures, burned the ;$3. 85; he owed the grocer.
His head ached, the top of it ached, the back of it ached, the brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling,
while the ache over his brows was intolerable.
; He opened his eyes to escape it,
but the white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him to close his eyes, when the ;$3. 85; confronted him again.
Five dollars for five thousand words,
ten words for a cent that particular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could no more escape it than he could the ;$3. 85; under his eyelids.
he wandered through the endless corridors of his mind,
opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought the answer.
Then the ;$8. 00; began to smoulder under his lids again, and he returned himself to servitude.
He pulled a lever and made his mind revolve about him,
a monstrous wheel of fortune, a merry go round of memory, a revolving sphere of wisdom.
It was a new way of marking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw ;$3. 85; on one of the cuffs.
Then it came to him that it was the grocer's bill, and that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle.
Ever the heap grew, and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times,
he found only one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed Maria.
Now and again he reached out and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared through the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle.
Instead, at two in the morning, Maria, having heard his groans through the thin partition,
came into his room, to put hot flat irons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes.
By a supreme exertion of will, with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep them open,
he managed to get out of bed, only to be left stranded by his senses upon the table.
It seemed a life time since he had received that letter from the Transcontinental,
a life time since it was all over and done with and a new page turned.
Two days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a cup of tea, he asked for his mail,
but found his eyes still hurt too much to permit him to read.
He listened absently to a long dun from the type writer people, his mind busy with ways and means of finding a job.
;'We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your story,'; Teresa slowly spelled out,
;'provided you allow us to make the alterations suggested.';
The editor told him plainly that he had not handled the idea properly,
but that it was the idea they were buying because it was original.
He called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story down three thirds if he wanted to, and to send the forty dollars right along.
There were more stories in his head as good as ;The Whirlpool,;
and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more than in any job or position.
He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling over her handwriting,
loving each stroke of her pen, and in the end kissing her signature.
He told her that he had been sick, but was once more nearly well,
and that inside ten days or two weeks as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return ,
he would redeem his clothes and be with her.
The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur, she arrived in the Morse carriage,
to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of all the urchins on the street, and to the consternation of Maria.
She boxed the ears of the Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny front porch,
and in more than usual atrocious English tried to apologize for her appearance.
So flustered was she by two such grand young people asking for her lodger,
that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the little parlor.
Maria, in her excitement, jammed the bedroom and bedroom closet doors together, and for five minutes,
through the partly open door, clouds of steam, smelling of soap suds and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.
in running the narrow passage between table and bed to Martin's side;
but Arthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and pans in the corner where Martin did his cooking.
Ruth occupied the only chair, and having done his duty, he went outside and stood by the gate,
the centre of seven marvelling Silvas, who watched him as they would have watched a curiosity in a side show.
Here was neither marriage nor death: therefore, it was something transcending experience and well worth waiting for.
So it was while Martin held her hand and gladly talked,
that her love for him prompted her to press his hand in return, and that her eyes were moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks suffering had stamped upon his face.
But while he told her of his two acceptances,
of his despair when he received the one from the Transcontinental,
and of the corresponding delight with which he received the one from the White Mouse, she did not follow him.
She was not aware of it, however, any more than she was aware that her desire that Martin take a position was the instinctive and preparative impulse of motherhood.
She would have blushed had she been told as much in plain, set terms, and next, she might have grown indignant and asserted that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire for him to make the best of himself.
So, while Martin poured out his heart to her, elated with the first success his chosen work in the world had received,
she paid heed to his bare words only, gazing now and again about the room, shocked by what she saw.
Not alone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva house, inside and out,
but it seemed to emphasize that animal like strength of his which she detested.
She leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes,
and as he looked at her delicate face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck with his own unworthiness.
In an insistent way she had caught glimpses of the large, easy going side of his nature,
and she felt sure, if she asked him to cease attempting to write, that he would grant her wish.
I am sure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good to be a slave to anything, to a drug least of all.;
She left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes lines of notes overhead,
learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending his wheel under the ceiling,
and being saddened by the heap of manuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much wasted time.
she saw him double his arm at the elbow, the biceps crawling under his shirt sleeve and swelling into a knot of muscle, heavy and hard.
But her pulse, her blood, every fibre of her, loved it and yearned for it,
and, in the old, inexplicable way, she leaned toward him, not away from him.
And in the moment that followed, when he crushed her in his arms,
the brain of her, concerned with the superficial aspects of life, was in revolt;
It was in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of her love for Martin,
for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to feel his strong arms about her, holding her tightly, hurting her with the grip of their fervor.
At such moments she found justification for her treason to her standards, for her violation of her own high ideals,
and, most of all, for her tacit disobedience to her mother and father.
With him, she loved him in truth, at times a vexed and worried love; but love it was, a love that was stronger than she.
; ; she queried absently, intent on the heaven sent justification she was finding in his arms,
Have you had that, too?
Martin's sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by the indoor life he was living,
while the hunger and the sickness had made his face even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of a blush.
And for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes
a gale at night, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas glinting coldly in the moonlight.
That was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her throat, and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the window.
I shall grow more catholic in time,
but at present I can't help being jealous of those ghosts of the past, and you know your past is full of ghosts.;
she called back from the door, ;
There's some kind of a mixture, put up by the druggists, that helps men to stop the use of tobacco,and I am going to send you some.;
Maria, with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the texture of Ruth's garments and the cut of them,
a cut unknown that produced an effect mysteriously beautiful , saw her to the carriage.
The crowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared from view, then transferred their stare to Maria, who had abruptly become the most important person on the street.
But it was one of her progeny who blasted Maria's reputation by announcing that the grand visitors had been for her lodger.
After that Maria dropped back into her old obscurity and Martin began to notice the respectful manner in which he was regarded by the small fry of the neighborhood.
As for Maria, Martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per cent, and had the Portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriage,
call he would have allowed Martin an additional three dollars and eighty five cents' worth of credit.
The day after Ruth's visit, he received a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in payment for three of his triolets.
Two days later a newspaper published in Chicago accepted his ;Treasure Hunters,;
promising to pay ten dollars for it on publication.
To cap everything, the adventure serial for boys,
his second attempt, was accepted before the end of the week by a juvenile monthly calling itself Youth and Age.
It was true the serial was twenty one thousand words,
and they offered to pay him sixteen dollars on publication,
which was something like seventy five cents a thousand words;
but it was equally true that it was the second thing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly aware of its clumsy worthlessness.
What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great strength
the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a war club.
There was a compromise that approximated the truth,
though it flattered not the school of god, while it challenged the brute savageness of the school of clod.
It was his story, ;Adventure,; which had dragged with Ruth, that Martin believed had achieved his ideal of the true in fiction; and it was in an essay,
;God and Clod,; that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject.
His early work counted for nothing in his eyes except for the money it brought,
and his horror stories, two of which he had sold, he did not consider high work nor his best work.
To him they were frankly imaginative and fantastic, though invested with all the glamour of the real, wherein lay their power.
The trick had been to fling over the face of his artistry a mask of humanness,
and this he had done in the half dozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written before he emerged upon the high peaks of ;Adventure,; ;Joy,; ;The Pot,; and ;The Wine of Life.;
He cashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer, paying a dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the baker and the fruit store.
Martin was not yet rich enough to afford meat,
and he was on slim allowance when the White Mouse check arrived.
He had never been in a bank in his life, much less been in one on business,
and he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in Oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars.
On the other hand, practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of credit.
Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer,
paying his bill with him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin.
Also, he paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his suit and his bicycle,
paid one month's rent on the type writer,
and paid Maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance.
He had been so long without money that, like a rescued starving man who cannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight,
Martin could not keep his hand off the silver.
but now, with nearly all debts paid, three dollars jingling in his pocket, and in his mind the consciousness of success,
Ruth's two girl cousins were visiting her from San Rafael,
and Mrs. Morse, under pretext of entertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young people.
Thus, in addition to the cousins Dorothy and Florence, Martin encountered two university professors, one of Latin, the other of English;
a young army officer just back from the Philippines, one time school mate of Ruth's;
finally of the men, a live bank cashier, Charles Hapgood,
a youngish man of thirty five, graduate of Stanford University, member of the Nile Club and the Unity Club, and a conservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns
Among the women was one who painted portraits, another who was a professional musician,
and still another who possessed the degree of Doctor of Sociology and who was locally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of San Francisco.
He bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his own awkwardness, especially of his shoulders,
which were up to their old trick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments.
He had never before been in contact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them.
For underneath Martin's awe lurked his assertive ego,
and he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women and to find out what they had learned from the books and life which he had not learned.
Ruth's eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on,
and she was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got acquainted with her cousins.
But he, on the other hand, a wit in his own class, a gay quizzer and laughter maker at dances and Sunday picnics,
had found the making of fun and the breaking of good natured lances simple enough in this environment.
And on this evening success stood at his back, patting him on the shoulder and telling him that he was making good,
so that he could afford to laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed.
though Martin no longer wove the air with his hands,
to Ruth's critical eye he permitted his own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently,
talked too rapidly and warmly, grew too intense, and allowed his aroused blood to redden his cheeks too much.
And the best that is in them is what they are interested in, the thing by which they make their living,
the thing they've specialized on and sat up days and nights over, and even dreamed about.
Imagine Mr Butler living up to social etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul Verlaine or the German drama or the novels of D'Annunzio.
It's the best that is in him, and life is so short that I want the best of every man and woman I meet.;
To listen to conversation about such things would mean to be bored,
wherefore the idlers decree that such things are shop and must not be talked about.
Likewise they decree the things that are not shop and which may be talked about,
and those things are the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards, cocktails,
automobiles, horse shows, trout fishing, tuna fishing, big game shooting, yacht sailing, and so forth and mark you,
the funniest part of it is that many of the clever people, and all the would be clever people, allow the idlers so to impose upon them.
As for me, I want the best a man's got in him, call it shop vulgarity or anything you please.;
Sacramento gives us our appropriations and therefore we kowtow to Sacramento,
and to the Board of Regents, and to the party press, or to the press of both parties.;
or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd, drinking claret, dago red they call it in San Francisco,
dining in cheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously radical views upon all creation.
I grow timid when I am face to face with my human frailty,
which ever prevents me from grasping all the factors in any problem human, vital problems, you know.;
He was almost humming the words,
and it dawned upon him that the other reminded him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady, and cool, and strong.
Martin had the feeling that he never spoke his full mind,
just as he had often had the feeling that the trades never blew their strongest ,
but always held reserves of strength that were never used.
Whatever occurred in the instant present, Martin's mind immediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which ordinarily expressed themselves to him in vision.
Just as Ruth's face, in a momentary jealousy had called before his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale,
as Professor Caldwell made him see again the Northeast Trade herding the white billows across the purple sea,
so, from moment to moment, not disconcerting but rather identifying and classifying, new memory visions rose before him,
or spread under his eyelids, or were thrown upon the screen of his consciousness.
These visions came out of the actions and sensations of the past, out of things and events and books of yesterday and last week
So it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell's easy flow of speech
the conversation of a clever, cultured man that Martin kept seeing himself down all his past.
He saw himself when he had been quite the hoodlum, wearing a ;stiff rim; Stetson hat and a square cut, double breasted coat,
with a certain swagger to the shoulders and possessing the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted.
At one time in his life he had been just a common hoodlum, the leader of a gang that worried the police and terrorized honest, working class householders.
and at the same moment the ghost of his early youth, in stiff rim and square cut, with swagger and toughness, stalked across the room.
He had fitted in wherever he found himself,
been a favorite always and everywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his willingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect.
He had been perturbed always by a feeling of unrest, had heard always the call of something from beyond,
and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found books and art and love.
Oh, I mean the real interpretative biology,
from the ground up, from the laboratory and the test tube and the vitalized inorganic right on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations.;
;And it seems to me,; Martin continued,
;that knowledge of the land question, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot be had without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life.
How can we understand laws and institutions, religions and customs, without understanding, not merely the nature of the creatures that made them,
but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made?
The evolution of the tool, of the harp, of music and song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated;
but how about the evolution of the human himself, the development of the basic and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or gibbered his first chant?
And you, in turn, or so it seems to me, leave out the biological factor, the very stuff out of which has been spun the fabric of all the arts, the warp and the woof of all human actions and achievements.;
To Ruth's amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, a
nd that the professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for Martin's youth.
;Do you know,; he said at last, ;I've had that same criticism passed on me once before
by a very great man, a scientist and evolutionist, Joseph Le Conte.
But he is dead, and I thought to remain undetected; and now you come along and expose me.
Ruth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him aside, whispering:
;You shouldn't have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way.
I once thought that everybody who went to universities,
or who sat in the high places in society, was just as brilliant and intelligent as he.;
Not once did his eyes flash nor his cheeks flush,
while the calmness and poise with which he talked surprised her.
But in Martin's estimation the whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a few hundred per cent,
and for the rest of the evening he labored under the impression that bank cashiers and talkers of platitudes were synonymous phrases.
The army officer he found good natured and simple, a healthy, wholesome young fellow,
content to occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him.
;I really don't object to platitudes,; he told Ruth later;
;but what worries me into nervousness is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior certitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it.
Why, I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union Labor Party had fused with the Democrats.
Mr. Butler says he is safe and honest calls him the Rock, Peter,
and says that upon him any banking institution can well be built.;
I don't care how nimble her fingers are, how perfect her technique,
how wonderful her expression the fact is, she knows nothing about music.;
I asked her what music meant to her you know I'm always curious to know that particular thing;
and she did not know what it meant to her,
except that she adored it, that it was the greatest of the arts, and that it meant more than life to her.;
He paused for a moment, and watched the youthful shade of himself, in stiff rim and square cut,
enter the door and swagger across the room.
But now, from what little I've seen of them, they strike me as a pack of ninnies, most of them,
and ninety percent of the remainder as bores.
;I attended two lecture courses under him, and I have known him for two years;
that is why I am anxious for your first impression.;
What I mean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of things,
and is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to himself that he never saw it.
all the time, in his innermost heart, is regretting that he has not done them;
who has secretly laughed at the rewards for doing,
and yet, still more secretly, has yearned for the rewards and for the joy of doing.;
He was superior to the climb, and he did not, with false modesty, hide it from himself ,
he was superior to the beings among whom he had climbed with the exception, of course, of Professor Caldwell.
nor did he know that the persons who were given to probing the depths and to thinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of the world's Morses;
nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely eagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its swarming freight of gregarious life.
For twenty five days, working Sundays and holidays, he toiled on,
;The Shame of the Sun,; a long essay of some thirty thousand words.
It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the Maeterlinck school
an attack from the citadel of positive science upon the wonder dreamers,
but an attack nevertheless that retained much of beauty and wonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact.
During the twenty five days spent on ;The Shame of the Sun,;
he sold hack work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents.
As a result, having exhausted his credit with the tradesmen though he had increased his credit with the grocer to five dollars ,
his wheel and suit of clothes went back to the pawnbroker.
The type writer people were again clamoring for money,
insistently pointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be paid strictly in advance.
He read them over in order to find out how not to write newspaper storiettes,
and so doing, reasoned out the perfect formula.
He found that the newspaper storiette should never be tragic,
should never end unhappily,
and should never contain beauty of language, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy of sentiment.
Sentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble, of the sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from; nigger heaven;
the ;For God my country and the Czar; and ;I may be poor but I am honest; brand of sentiment.
Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted ;The Duchess; for tone, and proceeded to mix according to formula.
But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties with;
though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell, thewedding bells must go on ringing just the same.
In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose, fifteen hundred words maximum dose.
Before he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin worked out half a dozen stock forms,
which he always consulted when constructing storiettes.
These forms were like the cunning tables used by mathematicians, which may be entered from top, bottom, right, and left,
which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns, and from which may be drawn,
without reasoning or thinking, thousands of different conclusions, all unchallengably precise and true.
Thus, in the course of half an hour with his forms, Martin could frame up a dozen or so storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at his convenience.
He found that he could fill one in, after a day of serious work, in the hour before going to bed.
He had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula,
and for once he knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the first two he sent off would bring checks.
that it was a fourth rater, or tenth rater, without standing,
with a crazy circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic appealing, and with advertisements that were scarcely more than charitable donations.
Nor could he have guessed that the particular five dollars that belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager for the painting of his house in Alameda, which painting he performed himself, on week day afternoons,
The article had been published, as he had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading room,
but no word could he get from the editor.
It was nothing less than robbery, he concluded
a cold blooded steal; while he starved, he was pilfered of his merchandise, of his goods, the sale of which was the sole way of getting bread to eat.
Youth and Age was a weekly, and it had published two thirds of his twenty one thousand word serial when it went out of business.
His chief reason for submitting it to that publication was that, having only to travel across the bay from Oakland, a quick decision could be reached.
Two weeks later he was overjoyed to see, in the latest number on the news stand, his story printed in full, illustrated, and in the place of honor.
He went home with leaping pulse, wondering how much they would pay him for one of the best things he had done.
Even if it isn't more than five dollars,
Martin thought to himself, it will buy enough beans and pea soup to enable me to write half a dozen like it, and possibly as good.
;On rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under the misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts.
He discovered in himself, at this period, a passion for perfection, under the sway of which he rewrote and polished ;The Jostling Street,; ;The Wine of Life,; ;Joy,; the ;Sea Lyrics,; and others of his earlier work.
Ruth's promised cure for the habit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away in the most inaccessible corner of his bureau.
Especially during his stretches of famine he suffered from lack of the weed;
but no matter how often he mastered the craving, it remained with him as strong as ever.
The storiettes at least kept the pot a boiling and gave him time for ambitious work;
while the one thing that upheld him was the forty dollars he had received from The White Mouse.
He anchored his faith to that, and was confident that the really first class magazines would pay an unknown writer at least an equal rate, if not a better one.
His best stories, essays, and poems went begging among them,
and yet, each month, he read reams of dull, prosy, inartistic stuff between all their various covers.
No matter if my work is unusual, no matter if it is unfit, for prudential reasons, for their pages, surely there must be some sparks in it, somewhere, a few, to warm them to some sort of appreciation.
And thereupon he would get out one or another of his manuscripts, such as ;Adventure,;
and read it over and over in a vain attempt to vindicate the editorial silence.
They were accompanied by a brief letter to the effect that the syndicate was overstocked,
and that some months would elapse before it would be in the market again for manuscripts.
So he had looked upon the ten as good as sold, and he had lived accordingly, on a basis of fifty dollars in the bank.
So it was that he entered abruptly upon a lean period, wherein he continued selling his earlier efforts to publications that would not pay ,
and submitting his later work to magazines that would not buy.
It was at this time that he wrote letters of inquiry to the several great monthly and quarterly reviews,
Manuscript readers and editors were away on vacation,
and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more.
Only the robber publications seemed to remain actively in business,
and to them Martin disposed of all his early efforts, such as ;Pearl diving,; ;The Sea as a Career,; ;Turtle catching,; and ;The Northeast Trades.
It is true, after six months' correspondence, he effected a compromise, whereby he received a safety razor for ;Turtle catching,;
and that The Acropolis, having agreed to give him five dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions: for ;The Northeast Trades,; fulfilled the second part of the agreement.
For a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a Boston editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste and a penny dreadful purse.
;The Peri and the Pearl,; a clever skit of a poem of two hundred lines,
just finished, white hot from his brain, won the heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine published in the interest of a great railroad.
When the editor wrote, offering him payment in transportation, Martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was transferable.
this time to The Hornet, a pretentious monthly that had been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist who founded it.
It was written by a new editor, who coolly informed Martin that he declined to be held responsible for the old editor's mistakes,
and that he did not think much of ;The Peri and the Pearl; anyway.
He had refrained from offering his ;Sea Lyrics; for publication, until driven to it by starvation.
The first month four were published, and he promptly received a cheek for four dollars;
but when he looked over the magazine, he was appalled at the slaughter.
In some cases the titles had been altered: ;Finis,; for instance, being changed to ;The Finish,; and ;The Song of the Outer Reef; to ;The Song of the Coral Reef.
He could not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of such maltreatment,
and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer.
Month by month the slaughter went on till the thirty poems were published,
and month by month he received a check for those which had appeared in the current number.
Despite these various misadventures, the memory of the White Mouse forty dollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more to hack work.
At his lowest ebb, when his black suit was in pawn,
he made a ten strike or so it seemed to him in a prize contest arranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party.
There were three branches of the contest,
and he entered them all, laughing at himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to live.
His poem won the first prize of ten dollars, his campaign song the second prize of five dollars,
his essay on the principles of the Republican Party the first prize of twenty five dollars.
While this affair was hanging fire, he proved that he understood the principles of the Democratic Party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar contest.
Driven to shifts in order to see Ruth,
and deciding that the long walk from north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time,
he kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle.
Besides, he no longer had opportunity to see much of her in her own home,
where Mrs. Morse was thoroughly prosecuting her campaign of entertainment.
As it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by his early environment, so now he perceived that she was similarly handicapped.
In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their masks of conservative broadmindedness,
they were two generations behind interpretative science:
their mental processes were mediaeval,
while their thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe struck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the youngest race, as old as the cave man, and older
that moved the famous British ecclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as to win immediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the page of history.
So Martin thought, and he thought further, till it dawned upon him that the difference between these lawyers, officers,
business men, and bank cashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had known was on a par with the difference in the food they ate,
clothes they wore, neighborhoods in which they lived.
when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn,
he moved among them a lord of life, quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goat herds.
The conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse, who had been invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood.
It was so cleverly stupid and unoriginal, and also so convincing, that the leaders cannot help but regard him as safe and sure,
while his platitudes are so much like the platitudes of the average voter that
while Ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other,
and Mrs. Morse beamed happily at the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lord's antagonism.
;Because I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty, equality, and fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,; Martin said with a smile.
You still believe in equality, and yet you do the work of the corporations,
and the corporations, from day to day, are busily engaged in burying equality.
Thus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with economic morality, or the morality of class;
and soon it became to him a grisly monster.
Personally, he was an intellectual moralist, and more offending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those about him,
which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic, the metaphysical, the sentimental, and the imitative.
Marian had called on Martin in his room a short time before to announce her engagement,
during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin's palm and told his fortune.
Instead, her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her betrothed,
and Martin, following her gaze, saw spread on that worthy's asymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval.
The incident passed over, they made an early departure,
and Martin forgot all about it, though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman, even of the working class,
should not have been flattered and delighted by having poetry written about her.
He says he won't have no wife of his with such things written about her which anybody can read He says it's a disgrace, an' he won't stand for it.;
He saw before him an unhappy girl,
knew the futility of attempting to convince her husband or her,
and, though the whole situation was absurd and preposterous, he resolved to surrender.
Marian and her husband would never know,
and neither himself nor they nor the world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever were published.
He nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn pieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacket ocular evidence of the success of her mission.
She reminded him of Lizzie Connolly,
though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life in her than in that other girl of the working class whom he had seen twice.
But they were on a par, the pair of them, in dress and carriage,
and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in Mrs. Morse's drawing room.
;Well, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business;
that when I write poetry about the girl he's keeping company with it's his business, but that outside of that he's got no say so.
He mused over the incident after she had gone,
and once or twice broke out into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her betrothed, all the members of his own class and the members of Ruth's class,
directing their narrow little lives by narrow little formulas
herd creatures, flocking together and patterning their lives by one another's opinions, failing of being individuals and of really living life ,
because of the childlike formulas by which they were enslaved.
He summoned them before him in apparitional procession:
Bernard Higginbotham arm in arm with Mr. Butler,
Hermann von Schmidt cheek by jowl with Charley Hapgood,
and one by one and in pairs he judged them and dismissed them
judged them by the standards of intellect and morality he had learned from the books.
Martin watched him and saw the stiff rim, the square cut, double breasted coat and the swaggering shoulders, of the youthful hoodlum who had once been he.
You fought and ruled the gang, not because you liked to, you know you really despised it,
but because the other fellows patted you on the shoulder.
you wouldn't give in partly because you were an abysmal brute and for the rest because you believed what every one about you believed,
that the measure of manhood was the carnivorous ferocity displayed in injuring and marring fellow creatures' anatomies.
Why, you whelp, you even won other fellows' girls away from them,
not because you wanted the girls, but because in the marrow of those about you, those who set your moral pace, was the instinct of the wild stallion and the bull seal.
The stiff rim and the square cut vanished, being replaced by milder garments;
the toughness went out of the face, the hardness out of the eyes;
and, the face, chastened and refined, was irradiated from an inner life of communion with beauty and knowledge.
The apparition was very like his present self, and, as he regarded it, he noted the student lamp by which it was illuminated, and the book over which it pored.
On a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which had seen their love declared the year before,
Martin read his ;Love cycle; to Ruth.
Now and again she had interrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure,
and now, as he laid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows, he waited her judgment.
She delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating to frame in words the harshness of her thought.
Don't think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding, for really I have my heart, all that I am, at stake.
And it is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past nor future,
and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style, and that certainly is not literature.
As it is, every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a violation of myself, of my self respect, of my respect for beauty.
She had read about it, studied about it, in the university in the course of earning her Bachelorship of Arts;
but she was not original, not creative, and all manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the harpings of others.
The existence of anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to exist to exist,
mark you, as the average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present conditions, but in all conditions.
It is their ignorance, of course, that makes them believe such rot
their ignorance, which is nothing more nor less than the henidical mental process described by Weininger.
Don't think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of writing.
The editors, sub editors, associate editors, most of them, and the manuscript readers for the magazines and book publishers, most of them,
nearly all of them, are men who wanted to write and who have failed.
And yet they, of all creatures under the sun the most unfit, are the very creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its way into print they,
who have proved themselves not original, who have demonstrated that they lack the divine fire, sit in judgment upon originality and genius.
Don't tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted to write poetry or fiction; for they have, and they have failed.
;But, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as you have shown so conclusively,
how is it possible that any of the great writers ever arrived?;
She frowned at his facetiousness a pretty, adorable frown that made him put his arm around her and kiss it away.
They are against you, you know; but I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you,
and at last father agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his office.
And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at the start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere.
Martin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart,
mechanically reaching for the tobacco and paper which he no longer carried to roll a cigarette,
muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.
;Frankly, though, and don't let it hurt you I tell you,
to show you precisely how you stand with him
he doesn't like your radical views, and he thinks you are lazy.
The question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the grayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made for him to go to work.
And she, having gone as far as she dared, was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.
They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa,
like Stanley, or to interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.;
;I understand all that,; he broke in;
;but what I want to know is whether or not you have lost faith in me?;
If I fall asleep early or late, I set the alarm accordingly;
and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my last conscious actions.;
There are times when I am light headed from want of sleep,
times when death, with its rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am haunted by Longfellow's lines:
I have a dream of laying my head on your breast and sleeping an aeon or so,
and the dream will come true ere another year is gone.;
in the moment his will opposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him.
The strength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in his impassioned voice,
his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and intellect surging in him.
a rift through which she caught sight of the real Martin Eden, splendid and invincible;
and as animal trainers have their moments of doubt, so she, for the instant, seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man.
Make me do such things, make me like those other men,
doing the work they do, breathing the air they breathe, developing the point of view they have developed,
;But you forget,; she interrupted, the quick surface of her mind glimpsing a parallel.
Doubtless their wives loved them, and suffered with them and for them, not because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion.;
;But there have been inventors who were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things;
and sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded.
Waiting on the corner for a car, she had seen him first,
and noted the eager, hungry lines of his face and the desperate, worried look of his eyes.
;If you want some more, bring the suit,; had been the reply that sent Martin out of the stuffy little den,
so desperate at heart as to reflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity.
Mrs. Higginbotham divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not going to follow her.
Martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly appearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders,
the tired face with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her feet, without elasticity
Martin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish,
hungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.
He saw them under the table on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for which he had no stamps,
and he saw their titles, just as he had typed them ;The High Priests of Mystery,; and ;The Cradle of Beauty.
Then the certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him, an able ally of hunger,
and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket.
;Because ; He faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the history of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of his attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith.
After Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post office and invested three of the five dollars in stamps;
later in the day, on the way to the Morse home,
he stopped in at the post office to weigh a large number of long, bulky envelopes,
he affixed to them all the stamps save three of the two cent denomination.
An hour later he decided that Brissenden was a boor as well, what of the way he prowled about from one room to another,
staring at the pictures or poking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from the table or drew from the shelves.
Though a stranger in the house he finally isolated himself in the midst of the company,
huddling into a capacious Morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had drawn from his pocket.
Martin noticed him no more that evening,
except once when he observed him chaffing with great apparent success with several of the young women.
after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting for him,
to say nothing of Herbert Spencer's Autobiography, which was as replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel.
And yet, it was not so much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated with the drink
the bright lights, the mirrors and dazzling array of glasses, the warm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices of men.
He was lonely, that was what was the matter with him;
that was why he had snapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook.
Not since with Joe, at Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of the wine he took with the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at a public bar.
Mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical exhaustion did, and he had felt no need for it.
But just now he felt desire for the drink, or, rather, for the atmosphere wherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of.
Martin, who was extremely strong headed, marvelled at the other's capacity for liquor,
and ever and anon broke off to marvel at the other's conversation.
But he noted that Brissenden had what Professor Caldwell lacked
namely, fire, the flashing insight and perception, the flaming uncontrol of genius.
or again, pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated, the thin lips shaped soft and velvety things,
mellow phrases of glow and glory, of haunting beauty, reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of life;
the thin lips were like a bugle, from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic strife, phrases that sounded clear as silver,
that were luminous as starry spaces, that epitomized the final word of science and yet said something more
the poet's word, the transcendental truth, elusive and without words which could express,
and which none the less found expression in the subtle and all but ungraspable connotations of common words.
He, by some wonder of vision, saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism, where was no language for narration,
and yet, by some golden miracle of speech, investing known words with unknown significances,
he conveyed to Martin's consciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls.
And while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging from a long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat on a neighboring chair,
its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage of many books.
They were neither large nor small, while their color was a nondescript brown;
but in them smouldered a fire, or, rather, lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory.
Defiant, indomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the same time aroused pity.
The eyes had narrowed till they were eagle like,
and Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle beak with its dilated nostrils, defiant, assertive, aggressive.
;On the contrary ; Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over Martin's objective poverty,
passing from the well worn tie and the saw edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight fray of one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin's sunken cheeks.
; Brissenden exclaimed, imitating the spieler of a locally famous snake eater,
;Bosco! He eats 'em alive! Eats 'em alive!
;I could certainly eat you alive,; Martin said, in turn running insolent eyes over the other's disease ravaged frame.
You see, I laugh at the conventional little moralities of the herd;
then you drift by, say a sharp, true word, and immediately I am the slave of the same little moralities.;
;I'll go you,; Martin answered, attempting to pay for the current Scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing the waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the table.
;No, no, not at all,; Martin answered, shaking hands and waving him to the solitary chair, himself taking to the bed.
Martin watched his long figure go down the outside steps, and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang the shoulders, which had once been broad, drawn in now over, the collapsed ruin of the chest.
;I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?
; he went on, holding up the volume in question.
;Though he's lucky if he pulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it out.;
;Yes, I know the spawn complacently pecking at him for his Father Damien letter, analyzing him, weighing him ;
;Yes, that's it, a good phrase, mouthing and besliming the True, and Beautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back and saying, 'Good dog, Fido.
So Martin unearthed a carbon copy of ;Star dust,; and during the reading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to sip his toddy.
;Strikes me you're a bit of star dust yourself, flung into a world of cowled gnomes who cannot see,; was his comment at the end of it.
What in hell's success if it isn't right there in your Stevenson sonnet, which outranks Henley's 'Apparition,' in that 'Love cycle,' in those sea poems?
There's not one of them who is not degrading, man and woman, all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and artistic impulses of clams ;
Oh, you will grow tired of them, too, of all the female things, if you are unlucky enough to live.
You won't go back to your ships and sea; therefore, you'll hang around these pest holes of cities until your bones are rotten, and then you'll die.;
;After all, you have but the wisdom of your temperament, and the wisdom of my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours.;
They disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but they liked each other, and on Martin's part it was no less than a profound liking.
Brissenden never arrived without his quart of whiskey, and when they dined together down town, he drank Scotch and soda throughout the meal.
He invariably paid the way for both, and it was through him that Martin learned the refinements of food, drank his first champagne, and made acquaintance with Rhenish wines.
He was unafraid to die, bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and yet, dying, he loved life, to the last atom of it.
He was possessed by a madness to live, to thrill, ;to squirm my little space in the cosmic dust whence I came,; as he phrased it once himself.
As he told Martin, he had once gone three days without water, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience the exquisite delight of such a thirst assuaged.
He told her that he would come, after all; that he would go over to San Francisco, to the Transcontinental office,
collect the five dollars due him, and with it redeem his suit of clothes.
The ten cents carried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco,
and as he walked up Market Street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to collect the money.
The door to the Transcontinental office was ajar,
and Martin, in the act of opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from within, which exclaimed:
;But that is not the question, Mr. Ford.
The door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry countenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching his fists.
Cards evidently were not necessary in that office, for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to see Mr. Ford.
But this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did not desire to scare him too abruptly.
Here he held Martin off at arm's length and ran his beaming eyes over Martin's second best suit, which was also his worst suit, and which was ragged and past repair,
though the trousers showed the careful crease he had put in with Maria's flat irons.
Still talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he introduced him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail little man whose hand seemed strangely cold,
as if he were suffering from a chill, and whose whiskers were sparse and silky.
Martin found himself shaking hands with a cranky eyed, bald headed man,
whose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it, for most of it was covered by a snow white beard, carefully trimmed
The three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once, until it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.
They sang his praises, told him what they had thought of his story at first sight, what
they subsequently thought, what their wives and families thought;
but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay him for it.
I was coming west from New York, and when the train stopped at Ogden, the train boy on the new run brought aboard the current number of the Transcontinental.;
The wrong done him by the Transcontinental loomed colossal, for strong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning, of hunger and privation,
and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him, reminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before, and little enough then.
Mr. Ford started anew to tell how he had first read ;
The Ring of Bells,; and Mr. Ends at the same time was striving to repeat his niece's appreciation of ;The Ring of Bells,; said niece being a school teacher in Alameda.
Mr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and happy acquiescence,
started to reach for his pocket, then turned suddenly to Mr. Ends, and said that he had left his money home.
That Mr. Ends resented this, was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his arm as if to protect his trousers pocket.
It was careless of me to be so short; but the bill was not yet due, and the printer's request, as a favor, to make an immediate advance, was quite unexpected.;
He had come into the Transcontinental to learn magazine literature, instead of which he had principally learned finance.
;The unfortunate circumstances if you had chanced here any other day,; Mr. Ford began suavely,
only to be interrupted by Mr. Ends, whose cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper.
He had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager's brusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye,
for it was in that gentleman's trousers pocket that he divined the Transcontinental's ready cash was reposing.
At the same instant Martin sprang for him, clutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that Mr. Ends' snow white beard,
still maintaining its immaculate trimness, pointed ceilingward at an angle of forty five degrees.
Martin was elated so elated that when he recollected that The Hornet owed him fifteen dollars for ;The Peri and the Pearl,; he decided forthwith to go and collect it.
But The Hornet was run by a set of clean shaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers who robbed everything and everybody, not excepting one another.
After some breakage of the office furniture, the editor an ex college athlete ,
ably assisted by the business manager, an advertising agent, and the porter, succeeded in removing Martin from the office,
and in accelerating, by initial impulse, his descent of the first flight of stairs.
;I hope your neck doesn't stiffen up,; the editor wished solicitously: ;What do you say we all go out and have a drink on it not the neck, of course, but the little rough house?;
And robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the battle was to the strong,
and that the fifteen dollars for, ;The Peri and the Pearl; belonged by right to The Hornet's editorial staff.
She had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner;
but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the one with which he was full.
;Here, let me read you this,; he cried, separating the carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape.
It is so altogether different that am almost afraid of it, and yet I've a sneaking idea it is good.
She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:
And a strange sight it was, this tiny dark haired person sitting there with her feet nowhere near touching the floor,
totally absorbed in the wonderful adventures of Pip and old Miss Havisham and her cobwebbed house
Mrs Phelps always felt sad when the time came for her to cross the floor and say, ;It's ten to five, Matilda.;
Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy
The Invisible Man by H.
G. Wells
The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner
The Good Companions by J.
B. Priestley
Almost anyone else witnessing the achievements of this small child would have been tempted to make a great fuss and shout the news all over the village and beyond, but not so Mrs Phelps.
Matilda's parents owned quite a nice house with three bedrooms upstairs, while on the ground floor there was a dining room and a living room and a kitchen.
The suppers were TV dinners in floppy aluminium containers with separate compartments for the stewed meat, the boiled potatoes and the peas.
Her safety valve, the thing that prevented her from going round the bend, was the fun of devising and dishing out these splendid punishments,
The father in particular became less cocky and unbearable for several days after receiving a dose of Matilda's magic medicine.
He has sold no less than five cars, each one at a tidy profitSawdust in the gear boxes, the electric drill on the speedometer cables,
Some curious warmth that was almost tangible shone out of Miss Honey's face when she spoke to a confused and homesick newcomer to the class.
She started wondering whether per mission might not be sought from the parents for her to give private tuition to Matilda after school.
Nosey cook might have been better, Miss Honey thought She was given to playing with words in that way.
the man said as he led her into the sittingroom where a large platinum blonde woman was gazing rapturously at the TV screen.
;But does it not intrigue you;, Miss Honey said, ;that a little five year old child is reading long adult novels by Dickens and Hemingway?
Only yesterday the Trunchbull caught a boy called Julius Rottwinkle eating Liquorice Allsorts during the scripture lesson and she simply picked him up by one arm and flung him clear out of the open classroom window.
Matilda and Lavender saw the giant in green breeches advancing upon a girl of about ten who had a pair of plaited golden pigtails hanging over her shoulders.
He was watching the Headmistress with an exceedingly wary eye and he kept edging farther and farther away from her with little shuffles of his feet,
rather as a rat might edge away from a terrier that is watching it from across the room.
What is more, he had now become very conscious of his audience and of how they were all silently rooting for him.
But he kept pushing the stuff into his mouth with the dogged perseverance of a long distance runner who has sighted the finishing line and knows he must keep going.
She also admired Matilda who had sworn her to secrecy about the parrot job she had brought off at home, and also the great hair oil switch which had bleached her father's hair.
He twisted and squirmed and kicked the air and went on yelling like a stuck pig,
The Trunchbull flicked her head round and looked carefully at the small girl with dark hair and deep brown eyes sitting in the second row.
And now the children also saw the long thin slimy yellow bellied lizard like creature twisting and turning in the glass,
I only have to take a moment to get my eyes strong and then I can push it out,
this strongness, at anything at all so long as I am staring at it hard enough'
I have to stare at it very hard, Miss Honey, very very hard, and then I can feel it all happening behind my eyes,
Fear or believe that the wolf in the sheepwhite hood Loping and bleating roughly and blithely shall leap, my dear, my dear,
In two strides the Trunchbull was beside him, and by some amazing gymnastic trick, it may have been judo or karate,
she flipped the back of Wilfred's legs with one of her feet so that the boy shot up off the ground and turned a somersault in the air.
;Eight threes,; the Trunchbull shouted, swinging Wilfred from side to side by his ankle, ;eight threes is the same as three eights and three eights are twenty four!
This document revealed that ever since her father's death, Miss Honey had in fact been the rightful owner of a property on the edge of the village known as The Red House,
which until recently had been occupied by a Miss Agatha Trunchbull.
One evening a few weeks later, Matilda was having tea with Miss Honey in the kitchen of The Red House after school as they always did, when Matilda said suddenly,
now its boot and all its doors were open and Mr and Mrs Wormwood and the brother were scurrying around it like ants, piling in the suitcases,
I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had;
and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt's memory which misleads her here.
With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, without throwing a shade on the Admiral.
;Do not you think,; said Fanny, after a little consideration, ;that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has been entirely brought up by her?
She made me almost laugh;
but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated.
I am sure William would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances.
And what right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters when you were absent?;
;The right of a lively mind, Fanny,
seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others;
perfectly allowable, when untinctured by ill humour or roughness;
and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford:
nothing sharp, or loud, or coarse,
She is perfectly feminine, except of two instances we have been speaking of.
There she cannot be justified.
I am glad you saw it all as I did.
; Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance of her thinking like him;
though at this period, and on this subject, there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity,
for he was in a line of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny could not follow.
Miss Crawford's attractions did not lessen.
The harp arrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit, and good humour;
for she played with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming,
and there was something clever to be said at the close of every air.
Edmund was at the Parsonage every day, to be indulged with his favourite instrument:
one morning secured an invitation for the next;
for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.
A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and both placed near a window, cut down to the ground,
and opening on a little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was enough to catch any man's heart.
Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use:
it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set going,
even the sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking at.
Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he was about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love;
and to the credit of the lady it may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an elder brother,
without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he began to be agreeable to her.
She felt it to be so, though she had not foreseen, and could hardly understand it;
for he was not pleasant by any common rule: he talked no nonsense;
he paid no compliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil and simple.
Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;
she would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed, to hear the harp;
neither could she wonder that, when the evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again,
he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home,
while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park;
She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford, and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed,
and of which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was.
Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford,
but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared;
and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him, lest it should appear like ill nature.
The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride,
which the former caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at the Park,
and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish,
and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts, as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish.
The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin;
and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost over powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.
Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time,
before either Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward.
Active and fearless, and though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman;
and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in Edmund's attendance and instructions,
and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount.
Fanny was ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.
The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of each other;
by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could look down the park,
and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes, gently rising beyond the village road;
and in Dr. Grant's meadow she immediately saw the group
Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford, with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on.
At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not small, at a foot's pace;
then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter;
and to Fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat.
Edmund was close to her;
he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand;
she saw it, or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach.
She could not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble;
that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself;
but Mr. Crawford, with all his boasted good nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew nothing of the matter,
and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund.
She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty;
if she were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.
Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse,
and Miss Crawford still on horseback,
but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.
She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient;
and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.
;My dear Miss Price,; said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all within hearing, ;I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting;
but I have nothing in the world to say for myself
I knew it was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill;
and therefore, if you please, you must forgive me.
;For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,; said he,
;and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner:
clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then.
;No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,; said she, as she sprang down with his help;
;I am very strong.
Miss Price, I give way to you with a very bad grace;
but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride,
and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear, delightful, beautiful animal.;
The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now joining them,
Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another part of the park;
her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, as she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to the village;
nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford's great cleverness as a horse woman, which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own.
Her merit in being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams;
her delight in riding was like their own; her early excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure in praising it.
;I do not want her at all for myself,; said he;
;'but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning, in short.
Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort,
and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning:
the party included all the young people but herself,
and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion.
A successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another;
and the having been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after.
There were many other views to be shewn;
and though the weather was hot, there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go.
Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner,
in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the honours of its finest spots.
Everything answered; it was all gaiety and good humour,
the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure
till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded.
but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home.
As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him;
she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.
Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing room,
fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there,
for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half asleep;
and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill humour,
and having asked one or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say no more.
For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves;
but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking around, said, ;But where is Fanny?
Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table, and had taken up her work again;
and Julia, who was in high good humour, from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming,
;I must say, ma'am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house.;
;Yes, indeed, Edmund,; added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly awakened by Mrs.
;No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry;
and, unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key,
so she was obliged to go again.;
;I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,; cried Mrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf;
;unless I had gone myself, indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once;
and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother's dairymaid,
by _her_ desire, and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son, and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour.
But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind;
and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.
Between ourselves, Edmund,; nodding significantly at his mother, ;it was cutting the roses,
and dawdling about in the flower garden, that did the mischief.;
Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,
brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part.
She wished to be able to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made it easier to swallow than to speak.
Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly considered;
but she had been left four days together without any choice of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require.
He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding,
and very seriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford's, that it should never happen again.
The state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition;
for she had been feeling neglected,
and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past.
As she leant on the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head;
and the sudden change which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know how to support herself.
Fanny's rides recommenced the very next day;
and as it was a pleasant fresh feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been,
Edmund trusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon made good.
While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother,
who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been started a fortnight before,
and which, in consequence of her subsequent absence from home, had since lain dormant.
Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well pleased with its revival,
and an early day was named and agreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged:
the young ladies did not forget that stipulation,
and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk;
and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to the Parsonage directly,
and call on Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not.
and Mrs. Rushworth, a well meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of consequence,
but as it related to her own and her son's concerns, had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.
Lady Bertram constantly declined it;
but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come,
till Mrs. Norris's more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.
She will have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;
and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answer for his being most happy to join the party.
;The loss of her ladyship's company would be a great drawback,
and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, and it was a pity she should not see the place.;
Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the invitation;
and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood,
civilly declined it on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister;
Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful;
and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday,
to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage, and walk half way down the park with the two other ladies.
On his return to the breakfast room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford's being of the party were desirable or not,
or whether her brother's barouche would not be full without her.
The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea,
assuring her that the barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on which _one_ might go with him.
I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,
understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family.;
After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.
; ;And, my dear Edmund,; added Mrs. Norris, ;taking out _two_ carriages when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing;
and, between ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton:
he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage,
and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas, when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.;
;That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford's,; said Maria;
;but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and does not know how to drive.
;You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,; said he, addressing his mother, ;for wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates to yourself, to your own comfort.
If you could do without her, you would not wish to keep her at home?;
Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain
their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her,
which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over.
It would be something so very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth, whose own manners were such a pattern of good breeding and attention,
that she really did not feel equal to it.
Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny,
and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time;
but her opposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own scheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else.
When Edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth's account,
because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin,
Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,
;Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.;
;I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,; added Julia,
hastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself.
;Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,; was Edmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.
but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would be nothing without him.
The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general approbation.
Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party;
and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had it at her tongue's end, and was on the point of proposing it,
when Mrs. Grant spoke.
Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived,
Mr. Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready,
there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places.
While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most appearance of obliging the others, to secure it,
the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant's saying, as she stepped from the carriage, ;As there are five of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry;
The former was on the barouche box in a moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification;
and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies, and the barking of Pug in his mistress's arms.
Their road was through a pleasant country;
and Fanny, whose rides had never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge,
and was very happy in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty.
Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions;
and, in observing the appearance of the country, the bearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest, the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she felt.
That was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by her:
in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike her.
She had none of Fanny's delicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling;
she saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation; her attention was all for men and women, her talents for the light and lively.
In looking back after Edmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind them, or when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they were united, and a ;there he is; broke at the same moment from them both, more than once.
For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:
her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side, full of conversation and merriment;
and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh of the other,
was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over.
When Julia looked back, it was with a countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them, it was in the highest spirits:
;her view of the country was charming, she wished they could all see it,; etc.
; but her only offer of exchange was addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill,
and was not more inviting than this: ;Here is a fine burst of country.
I wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me press you ever so much,
and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they were moving again at a good pace.
She could not tell Miss Crawford that ;those woods belonged to Sotherton,;
she could not carelessly observe that ;she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth's property on each side of the road,; without elation of heart;
and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of court leet and court baron.
Miss Crawford was not slow to admire;
she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost.
Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility;
and even Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard with complacency.
Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach;
and after being at some pains to get a view of the house,
and observing that ;it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect,;
she added, ;Now, where is the avenue?
After the business of arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat,
and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining parlour,
where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance.
Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also;
but this was scarcely received as an amendment:
the young ladies neither smiled nor spoke.
Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them as had not been there before, was more acceptable,
for Miss Bertram was pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing something.
The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth's guidance were shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back,
with shining floors, solid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome in its way.
but Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach,
and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house.
On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny,
but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention;
for Miss Crawford, who had seen scores of great houses, and cared for none of them, had only the appearance of civilly listening,
while Fanny, to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all that
Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts, delighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm her imagination with scenes of the past.
and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth,
Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows.
Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other use than to contribute to the window tax, and find employment for housemaids,
;Now,; said Mrs. Rushworth, ;we are coming to the chapel, which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon;
but as we are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will excuse me.;
Fanny's imagination had prepared her for something grander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of devotion:
with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family gallery above.
Here are no aisles, no arches, no inscriptions, no banners.
No banners, cousin, to be 'blown by the night wind of heaven.
' No signs that a 'Scottish monarch sleeps below.';
;You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how confined a purpose,
compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries.
It was only for the private use of the family.
They have been buried, I suppose, in the parish church.
_There_ you must look for the banners and the achievements.
; ;It was foolish of me not to think of all that;
but I am disappointed.;
Before that period, as I understand, the pews were only wainscot;
and family seat were only purple cloth; but this is not quite certain.
;It is a pity,; cried Fanny, ;that the custom should have been discontinued.
There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with one's ideas of what such a household should be!
A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!;
;It must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure,
and say their prayers here twice a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.;
and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed,
when they woke with a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed, they would have jumped with joy and envy.
The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets starched up into seeming piety,
but with heads full of something very different
especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at and,
in those days, I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now.
; For a few moments she was unanswered.
Fanny coloured and looked at Edmund, but felt too angry for speech;
and he needed a little recollection before he could say, ;Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects.
We must all feel _at_ _times_ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish;
but if you are supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a habit from neglect,
what could be expected from the _private_ devotions of such persons?
;The mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_ circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, I believe;
and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with.
While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the chapel,
Julia called Mr. Crawford's attention to her sister, by saying, ;Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria,
standing side by side, exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed.
Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria, said, in a voice which she only could hear,
;I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar.;
Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two,
but recovering herself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not much louder, ;If he would give her away?;
;Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place directly,
if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether, and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.
; And she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother,
and expose her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover,
while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place.
;If Edmund were but in orders! ; cried Julia
, and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny:
;My dear Edmund, if you were but in orders now, you might perform the ceremony directly.
Miss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,
replied only, ;If I had known this before, I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect,;
and turned the subject.
Miss Bertram, displeased with her sister, led the way,
and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough.
The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs. Rushworth, never weary in the cause,
would have proceeded towards the principal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough.
;For if,; said he, with the sort of self evident proposition which many a clearer head does not always avoid,
;we are _too_ long going over the house, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors.
and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,
temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure grounds, as by one impulse,
one wish for air and liberty, all walked out.
;Suppose we turn down here for the present,; said Mrs. Rushworth, civilly taking the hint and following them.
;Here are the greatest number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.;
;James,; said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, ;I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party.
The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet.;
The lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,
contained beyond the first planted area a bowling green, and beyond the bowling green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades,
and commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness immediately adjoining.
Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked on.
for Julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth,
and restrain her impatient feet to that lady's slow pace,
while her aunt, having fallen in with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants, was lingering behind in gossip with her.
Poor Julia, the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was now in a state of complete penance, and as different from the Julia of the barouche box as could well be imagined.
The politeness which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape;
while the want of that higher species of self command, that just consideration of others, that knowledge of her own heart,
that principle of right, which had not formed any essential part of her education, made her miserable under it.
The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in turning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day behind.
A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness, which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of larch and laurel,
and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much regularity, was darkness and shade,
and natural beauty, compared with the bowling green and the terrace.
But I cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and eternally,
which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners which result from their influence.
If the man who holds it is so, it is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance,
and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear.;
How can two sermons a week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair's to his own, do all that you speak of?
It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt.
A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood,
where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character, and observing his general conduct, which in London can rarely be the case.
And with regard to their influencing public manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me,
or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding, the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life.
The _manners_ I speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of good principles; the effect, in short,
of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend;
Fanny made the first interruption by saying, ;I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood;
but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while.;
; She took it, however, as she spoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a connexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny.
We have taken such a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line,
for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path.;
I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it;
and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak within compass.;
A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they had been talking of;
and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and looking over a ha ha into the park, was a comfortable sized bench, on which they all sat down.
;That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there is nothing in the course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning:
seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to another,
straining one's eyes and one's attention,
hearing what one does not understand,
admiring what one does not care for.
;I shall soon be rested,; said Fanny;
;to sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.;
They would go to one end of it, in the line they were then in
for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the side of the ha ha and perhaps turn a little way in some other direction, if it seemed likely to assist them,
and be back in a few minutes.
Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist,
and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care,
but with great regret that she was not stronger.
A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption from any one.
;Miss Price all alone; and ;My dear Fanny, how comes this? ; were the first salutations.
She told her story.
first by her, and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others,
and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith's place.
After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park,
that their views and their plans might be more comprehensive.
It was the very thing of all others to be wished, it was the best,
it was the only way of proceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford's opinion;
Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key;
he had been very near thinking whether he should not bring the key;
he was determined he would never come without the key again;
but still this did not remove the present evil.
or I think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;
I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited.;
Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken, and, smiling with all the good humour of success, she said,
;Thank you, my dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good bye.;
She expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,
and with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, ;Heyday!
This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and let it pass:
Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt that it would not last,
He was posting away as if upon life and death,
and could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all were.;
The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away from.;
And she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not attending to Fanny's last question of whether she had seen anything of Miss Crawford and Edmund.
The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued absence, however, as she might have done.
He joined her within five minutes after Julia's exit;
and though she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree.
;Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure,
and I dare say you walked as fast as you could;
but still it is some distance, you know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house;
and when people are waiting, they are bad judges of time,
and every half minute seems like five.;
; Fanny thought she discerned in his standing there an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another attempt,
and she said, therefore, ;It is a pity you should not join them.
They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved;
and nothing of that sort, you know, can be settled without you.;
Mr. Rushworth was worked on. ;Well,; said he, ;if you really think I had better go:
it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing.
Fanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago,
and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search of them.
She followed their steps along the bottom walk,
and had just turned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more caught her ear;
the sound approached, and a few more windings brought them before her.
They were just returned into the wilderness from the park,
to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very soon after their leaving her,
and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last,
and had been sitting down under one of the trees.
This was their history.
It was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their absence.
but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour, when he had talked of only a few minutes,
On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the wilderness,
at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house.
Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster.
Whatever cross accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces, she had found a morning of complete enjoyment;
for the housekeeper, after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her to the dairy,
told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese;
and since Julia's leaving them they had been met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance,
for she had set him right as to his grandson's illness, convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him a charm for it;
and he, in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants, and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath.
On this _ rencontre_ they all returned to the house together,
there to lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit chat, and Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of dinner.
It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came in,
and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the object of the day.
By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other,
and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to Fanny's observation, to have been as much too late for re establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.
She felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them:
there was gloom on the face of each.
Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay,
and she thought that he was taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away any little resentment of the other two, and restore general good humour.
Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee,
a ten miles' drive home allowed no waste of hours;
and from the time of their sitting down to table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door,
At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said,
;I hope I am not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat.
; The request had not been foreseen, but was very graciously received, and Julia's day was likely to end almost as well as it began.
Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different, and was a little disappointed;
but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under it,
and enabled her to receive Mr. Rushworth's parting attentions as she ought.
There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;
take great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like the excellent one we had at dinner.
She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table,
and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns.
She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort;
and so to be sure it will.
I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen,
and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop;
The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters from Antigua,
which soon afterwards reached Mansfield.
It was much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father;
and to think of their father in England again within a certain period, which these letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.
His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet,
and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.
Maria was more to be pitied than Julia;
for to her the father brought a husband,
and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover,
on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend.
It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to throw a mist over it,
and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something else.
It would hardly be _early_ in November, there were generally delays, a bad passage or _something_;
that favouring _something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or their understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of.
Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return,
and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast of another young lady.
and though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with an attention not so easily satisfied.
but after tea, as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene,
while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte,
;Don't be affronted,; said she, laughing,
;but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.;
;There is no sacrifice in the case,; replied Edmund,
with a serious smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; ;it is entirely her own doing.;
;It is the same sort of thing,; said Fanny, after a short pause,
;as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that.
As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion,
Indolence and love of ease; a want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen.
I suspect that in this comprehensive and may I say commonplace censure, you are not judging from yourself,
but from prejudiced persons, whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing.
;Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or smiling of something else.
Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad, they were always wishing away.;
being at this present time the guest of my own brother, Dr. Grant.
And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me, and though he is really a gentleman,
and, I dare say, a good scholar and clever,
and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable,
_I_ see him to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have his palate consulted in everything;
and as he must, either in the navy or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman.
A man a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week,
cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the better for it himself.
It must make him think;
for though he may preach himself into a good humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.;
when, being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee,
she tripped off to the instrument, leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues,
from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread.
and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to,
and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene.
; ;I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny.
;We will stay till this is finished, Fanny,; said he,
turning his back on the window;
and as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,
moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it ceased, he was close by the singers,
and by the end of August he arrived himself,
to be gay, agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford demanded;
to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends,
to which she might have listened six weeks before with some interest,
and altogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual comparison, of her preferring his younger brother.
It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;
and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required:
his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but pleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear that he did not care about her;
and his indifference was so much more than equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park,
the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she did not believe she could accept him.
He went for a fortnight a fortnight of such dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their guard,
and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not to return;
and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of shooting and sleeping,
to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own motives,
and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was tending;
but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example, he would not look beyond the present moment.
The sisters, handsome, clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind;
and finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield,
he gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further.
Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the repeated details of his day's sport, good or bad,
his boast of his dogs, his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications, and his zeal after poachers,
subjects which will not find their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously;
and Julia, unengaged and unemployed, felt all the right of missing him much more.
Each sister believed herself the favourite.
Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she wished,
and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.
Everything returned into the same channel as before his absence;
his manners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no ground with either,
and just stopping short of the consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which might excite general notice.
Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike;
but since the day at Sotherton,
she could never see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure;
and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect,
had she been sure that she was seeing clearly, and judging candidly, she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant.
for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about,
that I thought something would certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere.
;Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you, Fanny, may be aware;
for I believe it often happens that a man, before he has quite made up his own mind,
will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman,
herself Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria;
and I am not at all afraid for her,
after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.;
Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think differently in future;
but with all that submission to Edmund could do,
and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others,
and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford's choice,
she knew not always what to think.
as well as to her feelings, and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a point of some similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;
and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen, for it was while all the,
other young people were dancing,
and she sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire,
longing for the re entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended.
It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady's first ball,
being the thought only of the afternoon,
built on the late acquisition of a violin player in the servants' hall,
and the possibility of raising five couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's just arrived on a visit.
It had, however, been a very happy one to Fanny through four dances,
and she was quite grieved to be losing even a quarter of an hour.
;I think, ma'am,; said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr. Rushworth and Maria,
who were partners for the second time, ;we shall see some happy faces again now.;
;Yes, ma'am, indeed,; replied the other, with a stately simper, ;there will be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part.
Miss Bertram did indeed look happy,
her eyes were sparkling with pleasure,
and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her partner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her;
How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect,
for she had been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.
Listening and wondering were all suspended for a time,
for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it must happen.
He came towards their little circle;
but instead of asking her to dance, drew a chair near her,
and gave her an account of the present state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom,
from whom he had just parted.
When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from the table,
and looking over it, said in a languid way,
;If you want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.
A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor,;
making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving, however, to be close at his elbow,
made so instantaneous a change of expression and subject necessary,
as Fanny, in spite of everything, could hardly help laughing at.
;My dear Tom,; cried his aunt soon afterwards, ;as you are not dancing, I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall you?
Now, you and I and Dr. Grant will just do;
and though _we_ play but half crowns, you know, you may bet half guineas with _him_.;
It raises my spleen more than anything,
to have the pretence of being asked, of being given a choice,
and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be!
The Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense,
and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable independence;
Mr. Bertram's acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth,
where they had spent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship,
if friendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates's being invited to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could, and by his promising to come;
and he did come rather earlier than had been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking up of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left Weymouth to join.
He came on the wings of disappointment,
and with his head full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party;
and the play in which he had borne a part was within two days of representation,
when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers.
To be so near happiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon.
Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course have immortalised the whole party for at least a twelvemonth!
Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and dresses, rehearsals and jokes,
was his never failing subject, and to boast of the past his only consolation.
Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting so strong among young people, that he could hardly out talk the interest of his hearers.
From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it was all bewitching,
and there were few who did not wish to have been a party concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill.
;A trifling part,; said he, ;and not at all to my taste,
and such a one as I certainly would not accept again;
but I was determined to make no difficulties.
Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford;
and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you know.
I was sorry for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more equal to the Baron
a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first ten minutes.
Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick,
but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself;
whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two.
;It was a hard case, upon my word;; and, ;I do think you were very much to be pitied,; were the kind responses of listening sympathy.
;It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time;
and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted.
It was but three days;
Well, the jointure may comfort _him_;
and perhaps, between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron,
This, though the thought of the moment,
for the inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in him who was now master of the house;
and who, having so much leisure as to make almost any novelty a certain good,
had likewise such a degree of lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty of acting.
The thought returned again and again.
;I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written,
from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat.
I feel as if I could be anything or everything;
as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers,
in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.
If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit, boxes, and gallery,\
and let us have a play entire from beginning to end;
;True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting;
but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade:
a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.;
After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasing by the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest;
and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy,
and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all, the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable.
He was determined to prevent it, if possible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation which passed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.
and the doors at the farther end, communicating with each other,
as they may be made to do in five minutes,
;You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act? ; said Edmund, in a low voice, as his brother approached the fire.
;I think it would be very wrong.
In a _general_ light, private theatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind.
;You take up a thing so seriously!
as if we were going to act three times a week till my father's return, and invite all the country.
But it is not to be a display of that sort.
We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new.
and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own.
I have no fears and no scruples.
And as to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive;
for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother;
and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks,
I shall think our time very well spent, and so,
Lady Bertram, sunk back in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease, and tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was getting through the few difficulties of her work for her.
;By Jove! this won't do,; cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with a hearty laugh.
;To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety I was unlucky there.;
Well, Edmund,; he continued, returning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again, ;And I am convinced to the contrary.
Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father,
and for anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a decided taste.
;If you are resolved on acting,; replied the persevering Edmund, ;I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; a
nd I think a theatre ought not to be attempted.
I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have;
and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now,
such as moving a bookcase, or unlocking a door,
or even as using the billiard room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it,
you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the breakfast room,
than we did before he went away, or to my sister's pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other, Absolute nonsense!;
Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly,
but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a little carpenter's work, and that's all;
and as the carpenter's work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be too absurd to talk of expense;
Don't imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself.
Don't act yourself, if you do not like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else.;
Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling throughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest some comfort,
;Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them.
and if I cannot convince them myself, I shall let things take their course, without attempting it through her.
Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears.;
His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,
were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.
There could be no harm in what had been done in so many respectable families,
and by so many women of the first consideration;
and it must be scrupulousness run mad that could see anything to censure in a plan like theirs,
comprehending only brothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be heard of beyond themselves.
Julia _did_ seem inclined to admit that Maria's situation might require particular caution and delicacy
but that could not extend to _her_ she was at liberty;
and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint,
and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother.
Edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage, calling out,
;No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram.
No want of understrappers: my sister desires her love,
and hopes to be admitted into the company,
and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.;
; And Edmund, silenced,
was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind of genius;
and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on anything else.
She started no difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest nephew and niece, who were all powerful with her;
and as the whole arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all to herself,
as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle, and importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself obliged to leave her own house,
where she had been living a month at her own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be spent in their service,
she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the project.
The business of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle;
and the carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties,
and having made the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was already at work, while a play was still to seek.
An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris,
with a saving by her good management of full three quarters of a yard ,
and was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting;
and as two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found.
There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people to be pleased, so many best characters required,
and, above all, such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy,
that there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal could hold out.
on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was evident that Mary Crawford's wishes, though politely kept back, inclined the same way:
but his determinateness and his power seemed to make allies unnecessary;
and, independent of this great irreconcilable difference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the whole,
but every character first rate, and three principal women.
Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor Othello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could satisfy even the tragedians;
and The Rivals, The School for Scandal, Wheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively dismissed with yet warmer objections.
Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all,
and wondering how it would end.
For her own gratification she could have wished that something might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play,
but everything of higher consequence was against it.
The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same speaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed ;Lovers' Vows!
Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody else wants it;
a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not dislike,
and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my best.
Mr. Yates was particularly pleased:
he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,
had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced to re rant it all in his own room.
The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition;
and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already, he did now, with the greatest alacrity, offer his services for the part.
To do him justice, however, he did not resolve to appropriate it;
for remembering that there was some very good ranting ground in Frederick, he professed an equal willingness for that.
by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to be considered,
and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron.
She was acknowledged to be quite right, and the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the proper Frederick.
Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth,
who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything;
he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful,
and that she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case.
But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.
Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play,
and with seeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the business.
She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury to herself:
it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, Maria was preferred;
the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood;
\and before Julia could command herself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too, by saying, ;Oh yes!
;Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork;
We cannot have two Agathas,
and we must have one Cottager's wife;
and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler.
If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it;
and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous, let her take Cottager's speeches instead of Cottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through;
_he_ is solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure.
;With all your partiality for Cottager's wife,; said Henry Crawford,
;it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister,
and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed on.
; turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little;
but while she hesitated what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss Crawford's better claim.
She looked suspiciously at her sister;
Maria's countenance was to decide it:
if she were vexed and alarmed
but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense.
With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she said to him, ;
You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions
though one might have supposed
but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!
;Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,; cried Julia,
with angry quickness: ;I am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do nothing else;
and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me.
; And so saying, she walked hastily out of the room,
leaving awkward feelings to more than one,
but exciting small compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of the whole, and who could not think of her as under the agitations of _jealousy_ without great pity.
A short silence succeeded her leaving them;
but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was eagerly looking over the play, with Mr. Yates's help, to ascertain what scenery would be necessary
while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under voice,
and the declaration with which she began of, ;I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly,
but that though I shall probably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse,;
was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.
When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in the room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_,
and Miss Bertram's resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.
The first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which had been left on the table,
and begin to acquaint herself with the play of which she had heard so much.
Her curiosity was all awake,
and she ran through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of astonishment,
that it could be chosen in the present instance,
that it could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre!
Agatha and Amelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home representation
the situation of one, and the language of the other, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty,
that she could hardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in;
and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make.
He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse,
and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him;
but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters,
and which was which, and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow,
he soon decided for the Count.
Miss Bertram approved the decision,
for the less he had to learn the better;
Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well, though affecting to despise it;
and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others, or draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for.
;It is to be Lovers' Vows; and I am to be Count Cassel,
and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a shooting dress.
My stupidity was abominable, for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford;
and it is so useful to have anything of a model!
Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, ;I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and;
with a bolder eye ;Miss Crawford is to be Amelia.;
, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth, Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying,
;I cannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford;
;I am perfectly acquainted with the play, I assure you;
This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better to lead than Maria;
and with far more good humour she answered, ;I am much obliged to you, Edmund;
you mean very well, I am sure:
but I still think you see things too strongly;
and I really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind.
_There_ would be the greatest indecorum, I think.;
I do not know the play; but, as Maria says,
if there is anything a little too warm and it is so with most of them it can be easily left out.
I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began,
for there was the loss of half a day's work about those side doors.
I _am_ of some use, I hope, in preventing waste and making the most of things.
I had been looking about me in the poultry yard, and was just coming out,
when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants' hall door with two bits of deal board in his hand,
bringing them to father, you may be sure;
mother had chanced to send him of a message to father,
and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board,
for he could not no how do without them.
I knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads;
and as I hate such encroaching people the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have always said so:
just the sort of people to get all they can ,
I said to the boy directly a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought to be ashamed of himself , ;_I'll_ take the boards to your father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can. ;
The boy looked very silly,
and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speak pretty sharp;
and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while.
Nobody was at the trouble of an answer;
the others soon returned; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only satisfaction.
Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick Jackson,
but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of,
for Edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he would not have owned it.
Mr. Yates, who was trying to make himself agreeable to Julia,
found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company;
and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in his head, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.
But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:
Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being reassembled in the drawing room, seated themselves in committee at a separate table,
and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was complimenting _her_.
;I must really congratulate your ladyship,; said she,
;on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties.
The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision;
and I do sincerely give you joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris,
and everybody else who is in the same predicament,;
glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to Edmund.
and standing by them, seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till,
as if struck by a sudden recollection, she exclaimed, ;My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out;
For a moment no one spoke;
and then many spoke together to tell the same melancholy truth,
that they had not yet got any Anhalt.
;I had my choice of the parts,; said Mr. Rushworth; ;but I thought I should like the Count best,
though I do not much relish the finery I am to have.;
;_I_ should have no objection,; she replied;
;for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported,
that is, if everything went well,
I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience;
but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_; looking round ,
;If _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would be Anhalt,; observed the lady archly, after a short pause;
It must be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer;
and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.;
Miss Crawford was silenced,
and with some feelings of resentment and mortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea table, and gave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.
You must get a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap,
and we must make you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes,
and you will be a very proper, little old woman.;
and looking distressfully at Edmund, who was kindly observing her;
but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile.
and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed by Maria, and Mr. Crawford,
and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious,
and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny;
and before she could breathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible
;What a piece of work here is about nothing:
;I am not going to urge her,; replied Mrs. Norris sharply;
;but I shall think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her
very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and what she is.
; Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny,
whose tears were beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, ;I do not like my situation:
this _place_ is too hot for me,;
and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself,
;Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening:
everybody is cross and teasing, but do not let us mind them;;
and with pointed attention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of being out of spirits herself.
By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board,
and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund's favour.
Fanny did not love Miss Crawford;
but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness;
and when, from taking notice of her work, and wishing _she_ could work as well,
and begging for the pattern,
and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course she would come out when her cousin was married,
Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea,
and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him,
and imagined him a very fine young man,
and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again
she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery,
or help listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.
The consultation upon the play still went on,
and Miss Crawford's attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram's telling her,
with infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler:
;We have but to speak the word; we may pick and chuse.
I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company,
I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox.
Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere,
While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:
so contrary to all their first protestations;
but Edmund said nothing.
After a moment's thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied,
;As far as I am concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible.
Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow;
and though Julia, who had scarcely opened her lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund, that,
;the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,;
;and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _his_ speeches,
and a great many of _my_ _own_, before we rehearse together.
It will be very disagreeable, and by no means what I expected.;
When the evening was over, she went to bed full of it,
her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack from her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in,
and her spirits sinking under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach.
To be called into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse,
to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act;
and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation,
had been too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so,
especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the subject.
Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time;
and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of,
and Edmund perhaps away, what should she do?
The little white attic, which had continued her sleeping room ever since her first entering the family, proving incompetent to suggest any reply,
she had recourse, as soon as she was dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking,
and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress.
There Miss Lee had lived, and there they had read and written, and talked and laughed, till within the last three years, when she had quitted them.
The room had then become useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,
when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above:
but gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and spent more of her time there;
and having nothing to oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now generally admitted to be hers.
The East room, as it had been called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny's, almost as decidedly as the white attic:
the smallness of the one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams, with every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of superiority could demand, were entirely approving it;
and Mrs. Norris, having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny's account, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted,
though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.
The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind as Fanny's;
and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be driven from it entirely, even when winter came.
Her plants, her books of which she had been a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling
her writing desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within her reach;
or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would do, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an interesting remembrance connected with it.
Everything was a friend, or bore her thoughts to a friend;
and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her;
though her motives had often been misunderstood, her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued;
though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory:
her aunt Bertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet more frequent or more dear,
Edmund had been her champion and her friend:
he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful;
and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.
The room was most dear to her,
and she would not have changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house,
though what had been originally plain had suffered all the ill usage of children;
and its greatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work, too ill done for the drawing room, three transparencies, made in a rage for transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window,
where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland,
a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of being anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William, with H. M. S.
To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on an agitated, doubting spirit,
to see if by looking at Edmund's profile she could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums she might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself.
But she had more than fears of her own perseverance to remove:
she had begun to feel undecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round the room her doubts were increasing.
Was she _right_ in refusing what was so warmly asked, so strongly wished for
what might be so essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisance had set their hearts?
It would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples;
and as she looked around her, the claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present that she had received from them.
The table between the windows was covered with work boxes and netting boxes which had been given her at different times, principally by Tom;
and she grew bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced.
A tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle;
Come in; was answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid.
I know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable, the _more_ than intimacy the familiarity.
After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect;
but I can think of no other alternative.
Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _may_,
of the unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man's being received in this manner: domesticated among us;
authorised to come at all hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints.
I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger;
and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations
perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be
it would be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to expose her to it.
;I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle.
But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business,
of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be well repaid.
As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing:
I have offended them, and they will not hear me;
but when I have put them in good humour by this concession,
I am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for.
;If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself,
and yet But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way,
riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act
no matter whom: the look of a gentleman is to be enough.
If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it over,
and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity.
I admire your little establishment exceedingly;
and as soon as I am gone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your table.
The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct, which had previously distressed her, and which had all slept while she listened to him, were become of little consequence now.
This deeper anxiety swallowed them up.
Edmund might still look grave,
and say he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in particular;
their point was gained: he was to act,
and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only.
They behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion,
betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth,
and seemed to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox,
as if they had been forced into admitting him against their inclination.
A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort;;
and when Edmund, pursuing that idea, gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience,
they were ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything.
Yates assured him that Anhalt's last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches.
There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this change in Edmund;
Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers,
and entered with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but one effect on him.
One advantage resulted from it to Fanny:
at the earnest request of Miss Crawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good humour, agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted;
and this was all that occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day;
and even this, when imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to whom she was obliged
it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude,
and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration.
Her heart and her judgment were equally against Edmund's decision:
she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made her wretched.
Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an insult,
with friendly expressions towards herself which she could hardly answer calmly.
Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous and important;
each had their object of interest, their part, their dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates:
all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested.
She alone was sad and insignificant:
she had no share in anything; she might go or stay;
Mrs. Grant was of consequence:
_her_ good nature had honourable mention;
her taste and her time were considered;
her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended, and praised;
and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted.
Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings;
but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions,
with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought to have been their cure;
and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her,
she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria's situation, or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself.
or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with forced gaiety to him alone, and ridiculing the acting of the others.
For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment,
but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses;
and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation,
he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather thought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant.
but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness,
as Henry must be the best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with a most persuasive smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other,
she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister, entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there,
and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general,
and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her.
and though he and Maria are very good friends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.;
;If you have such a suspicion, something must be done;
and as soon as the play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind;
and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he is Henry, for a time.;
She had loved, she did love still,
and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense of ill usage.
and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there,
some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth.
With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion, to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the same, the sisters,
under such a trial as this, had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or compassion.
Maria felt her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless of Julia;
and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a public disturbance at last.
Edmund, between his theatrical and his real part,
between Miss Crawford's claims and his own conduct, between love and consistency, was equally unobservant;
and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company, superintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for which nobody thanked her,
and saving, with delighted integrity, half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for watching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.
Everything was now in a regular train:
theatre, actors, actresses, and dresses, were all getting forward;
but though no other great impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves,
and that she had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first.
Entirely against _his_ judgment, a scene painter arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings;
and his brother, instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way.
He had learned his part all his parts, for he took every trifling one that could be united with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting;
and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all his parts together, and make him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.
that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible;
that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his part,
and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth, who was wanting a prompter through every speech.
and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria's avoidance of him,
and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from him.
Everybody had a part either too long or too short;
nobody would attend as they ought;
nobody would remember on which side they were to come in;
nobody but the complainer would observe any directions.
Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them;
Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to _her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the first act,
in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.
For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him;
and, between ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion.;
From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to remove;
As to his ever making anything tolerable of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother;
_she_, indeed, regretted that his part was not more considerable,
and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes;
but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword,
and the first line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter through the rest.
Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great pains to teach him how to learn,
giving him all the helps and directions in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him, and learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.
Norris thought her quite as well off as the rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it ;Come, Fanny,; she cried,;these are fine times for you
, but you must not be always walking from one room to the other,
you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too.
What is the play about, Fanny?
;I believe,; said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, ;there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once.;
Fanny did not share her aunt's composure:
she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time;
the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly, and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform.
She had read and read the scene again with many painful,
many wondering emotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a circumstance almost too interesting.
She worked very diligently under her aunt's directions,
but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent, anxious mind;
which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at once of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth.
A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat,
and she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed,
for a quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford.
I came here today intending to rehearse it with Edmund
by ourselves against the evening,
but he is not in the way;
and if he _were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I have hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two.aaaa
You will be so good, won't you?;
Fanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could not give them in a very steady voice.
; continued Miss Crawford, opening her book,
;Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?
;Here it is I did not think much of it at first but, upon my word.
There, look at that speech, and that, and that.
How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things?
Could you do it?
But then he is your cousin, which makes all the difference.
We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage.
There very good school room chairs, not made for a theatre, I dare say;
much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson.
I heard him as I came upstairs,
and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick.
I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as well as I could,
by whispering to him, 'We shall have an excellent Agatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her manner, so completely _maternal_ in her voice and countenance.
She began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire;
but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man.
With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;
and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought a pause,
and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.
Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting;
and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford,
consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them.
He too had his book, and was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to prepare for the evening,
without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house;
and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices.
Her spirits sank under the glow of theirs,
and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either.
Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady, not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer,
and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them.
She was invested, indeed, with the office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults;
but from doing so every feeling within her shrank she could not, would not, dared not attempt it:
had she been otherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation.
In watching them she forgot herself;
and, agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund's manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help.
It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was thanked and pitied;
but she deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise.
At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other;
and when again alone and able to recall the whole,
she was inclined to believe their performance would,
indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself.
Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end;
Edmund was in spirits from the morning's rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away.
All were alert and impatient;
the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram,
Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour;
and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted,
were waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.
After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say,
;If Miss Price would be so good as to _read_ the part.
;And I do believe she can say every word of it,; added Maria,
;for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places.
Fanny could not say she did _not_;
and as they all persevered, as Edmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on her good nature, she must yield.
They did begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be struck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house,
had proceeded some way when the door of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, ;My father is come!
Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing;
but every other heart was sinking under some degree of self condemnation or undefined alarm,
Jealousy and bitterness had been suspended:
selfishness was lost in the common cause;
but at the moment of her appearance,
Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart;
and as soon as she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her words,
he still kept his station and retained her sister's hand, her wounded heart swelled again with injury,
and looking as red as she had been white before,
she turned out of the room, saying, ;
_I_ need not be afraid of appearing before him.;
Her going roused the rest;
and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something.
A very few words between them were sufficient.
Maria joined them with the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three;
for the very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support.
Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a moment,
a moment of such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and anxiety.
; but they were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry,
and, encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others with delighted haste.
Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest,
by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering.
She was nearly fainting:
all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning,
and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him,
with solicitude on Edmund's account indescribable.
She had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts,
while the other three, no longer under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of vexation,
lamenting over such an unlooked for premature arrival as a most untoward event,
and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.
The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better understanding the family,
and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue.
while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for the evening,
and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea,
when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it.
and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves,
proposed Mr. Yates's accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.
But Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much of parental claims, or family confidence,
could not perceive that anything of the kind was necessary;
and therefore, thanking them, said,
;he preferred remaining where he was, that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _was_ come;
and besides, he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away.;
Fanny was just beginning to collect herself,
and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was settled,
and being commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,
saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.
Too soon did she find herself at the drawing room door;
and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come,
; and on perceiving her, came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her, calling her his dear Fanny,
kissing her affectionately, and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown!
His manner seemed changed,
his voice was quick from the agitation of joy;
and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness.
He led her nearer the light and looked at her again
inquired particularly after her health, and then, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point.
He inquired next after her family, especially William:
and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and thinking his return a misfortune;
and when, on having courage to lift her eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate,
every tender feeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.
and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house,
in the centre of his family, after such a separation,
made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree;
and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage,
and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put.
His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,
as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him
interrupting himself more than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home
coming unexpectedly as he did
all collected together exactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on.
By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken, unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife,
who was really extremely happy to see him,
and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.
She had been almost fluttered for a few minutes,
and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work,
move Pug from her side, and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband.
She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud her pleasure:
her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence:
she had done a great deal of carpet work, and made many yards of fringe;
and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own.
Not that she was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas's disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for her judgment had been so blinded that,
except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's pink satin cloak as her brother in law entered,
Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended, whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded;
and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about,
and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence.
Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch;
but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner:
he would take nothing, nothing till tea came he would rather wait for tea.
and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England,
when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup.
His immediate communications were exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now at one, now at another of the beloved circle;
but the pause was not long:
in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, ;
How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir Thomas?
We have just been trying, by way of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle.
The first day I went over Mansfield Wood,
and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton,
and we brought home six brace between us,
and might each have killed six times as many,
but we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.
For the present the danger was over,
and Fanny's sick feelings subsided;
but when tea was soon afterwards brought in,
and Sir Thomas, getting up, said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was returning.
He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance.
;It is time to think of our visitors,; said Maria, still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart, and caring little for anything else.
Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room;
and on casting his eye round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in the furniture.
The removal of the bookcase from before the billiard room door struck him especially,
before there were sounds from the billiard room to astonish him still farther.
His father's looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage,
and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well bred and easy Mr. Yates, making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram,
Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character,
but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement.
Tom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them,
but partial expression, began to see, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be some ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room;
and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard table, he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity.
A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side;
and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement,
Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much to offend his ideas of decorum,
and confirm his ill opinion of Mr. Yates's habits of thinking, from the beginning to the end of the story;
;My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford, and it spread
as those things always spread, you know, sir the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly.
Not less acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind her aunt's end of the sofa,
and, screened from notice herself, saw all that was passing before her.
Our company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, that nothing more can be done to night;
but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result.
Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer,
but he being entirely without particular regard for either,
without jealousy either in love or acting, could speak very handsomely of both.
;I do not say he is not gentleman like, considering;
but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight, or he will be expecting a well looking man.;
That I should be cautious and quick sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly natural;
and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs.
But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with you;
and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight.;
but as a well judging, steady young man, with better notions than his elocution would do justice to,
he intended to value him very highly.
but by looking, as he really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's good opinion,
and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towards preserving that good opinion a little longer.
Edmund's first object the next morning was to see his father alone,
and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme,
defending his own share in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his motives to deserve,
and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful.
He was anxious, while vindicating himself, to say nothing unkind of the others:
but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation.
Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party, and at such a time,
as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must;
he felt it too much, indeed, for many words;
and having shaken hands with Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could,
after the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance, and restored to its proper state.
He did not enter into any remonstrance with his other children:
he was more willing to believe they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.
The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the plan;
they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;
but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of unsteady characters;
and with greater surprise, therefore, he must regard her acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of their unsafe amusements, than that such measures and such amusements should have been suggested.
Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life;
Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house, and
within two hours afterwards from the parish;
and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram.
His presence was beginning to be odious to her;
By all the others it was mentioned with regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling
from the sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard, to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote.
and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it;
but with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_ activity to keep pace with her wishes?
wanting to be alone with his family, the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome;
but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was every way vexatious.
In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive.
Mr. Yates had staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield, the removal of everything appertaining to the play
he left the house in all the soberness of its general character;
and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing him out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,
and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence.
The curtain, over which she had presided with such talent and such success, went off with her to her cottage, where she happened to be particularly in want of green baize.
Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits of many others saddened
it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past
a sombre family party rarely enlivened.
Sir Thomas, drawing back from intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined,
at this time, for any engagements but in one quarter.
There was never much laughing in his presence;
or, if there is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first.
There must be a sort of shyness;
but I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except when my uncle was in town.
Ask your uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough:
and though they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.;
Anybody but myself would have made something more of it,
and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before;
but the truth is, that your uncle never did admire you till now
and now he does. ;Oh! don't talk so, don't talk so,; cried Fanny,
distressed by more feelings than he was aware of;
but seeing that she was distressed, he had done with the subject, and only added more seriously
And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word,
or seeming at all interested in the subject, I did not like
I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense,
by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel.;
She certainly understands _you_ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long;
and with regard to some others, I can perceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions of the moment,
that she could define _many_ as accurately, did not delicacy forbid it.
She must admire him as a fine looking man, with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners;
but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve may be a little repulsive.
I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country;
and November is a still more serious month,
and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.;
Fanny could have said a great deal,
but it was safer to say nothing, and leave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources
her accomplishments, her spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome.
I should dread the stupidity of the day,
if there were not a much greater evil to follow the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. Not all his good will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth's deference for him, could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth
that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant in business as in books,
with opinions in general unfixed, and without seeming much aware of it himself.
With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her:
told her his fears, inquired into her wishes,
entreated her to be open and sincere,
and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved, and the connexion entirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it.
Maria had a moment's struggle as she listened, and only a moment's:
when her father ceased, she was able to give her answer immediately, decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.
She thanked him for his great attention, his paternal kindness,
but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement,
or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it. and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly without the prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed.
Her feelings, probably, were not acute;
he had never supposed them to be so;
but her comforts might not be less on that account;
and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading, shining character,
there would certainly be everything else in her favour.
A well disposed young woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more attached to her own family;
and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all probability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments.
Such and such like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas, happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder, the reflections, the reproach that must attend it;
happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence,
and very happy to think anything of his daughter's disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.
She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall:
that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions, and destroying her prospects;
and retired in proud resolve, determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future, that her father might not be again suspecting her.
Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford's leaving Mansfield,
before her feelings were at all tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him,
or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have been different;
but after another three or four days, when there was no return, no letter, no message,
no symptom of a softened heart,
no hope of advantage from separation,
her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give.
Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he should not know that he had done it;
he should not destroy her credit, her appearance, her prosperity, too.
He should not have to think of her as pining in the retirement of Mansfield for him,
rejecting Sotherton and London, independence and splendour, for his sake.
In all the important preparations of the mind she was complete:
being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home, restraint, and tranquillity;
by the misery of disappointed affection, and contempt of the man she was to marry.
and very early in November removed herself, her maid, her footman, and her chariot, with true dowager propriety, to Bath,
there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties;
enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps, in the animation of a card table, as she had ever done on the spot;
and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress.
and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant.
Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood,
except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelve month before.
Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must feel,
and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive of for herself,
but had fortunately escaped. for she had made the match;
she had done everything;
and no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph, that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life,
or could have the smallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought up under her eye.
Since rivalry between the sisters had ceased,
they had been gradually recovering much of their former good understanding;
and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of them exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time.
and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria,
though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them,
The family circle became greatly contracted;
and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to its gaiety, they could not but be missed.
Even their mother missed them;
and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about the house,
and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!
In that house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's death,
she became a welcome,an invited guest,
and in the gloom and dirt of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford.
Mrs. Grant, really eager to get any change for her sister,
could, by the easiest self deceit, persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls.
Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage;
and being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises,
was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her part, to come in.
but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella,
there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;
and to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind,
sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning,
and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty four hours, the sound of a little bustle at the front door,
and the sight of Miss Price dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful.
She was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being useful to Fanny,
in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow, and providing her with dry clothes;
and Fanny, after being obliged to submit to all this attention,
and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids,
being also obliged, on returning downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing room for an hour while the rain continued,
the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner.
The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way, and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour,
and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant's carriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened.
As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that score;
for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware that none would be felt,
and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain,
her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.
It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the room, asked some questions about it,
which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it,
and a confession, which could hardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its being in Mansfield.
She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the instrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she should;
but Miss Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was concerned at her own neglect;
and ;Shall I play to you now? She played accordingly;
happy to have a new listener, and a listener who seemed so much obliged,
so full of wonder at the performance, and who shewed herself not wanting in taste.
Fanny felt that she must;
and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund,
such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea,
and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again,
perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with constant delight to the favourite air,
Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams' going away
an intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford's desire of something new, and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings.
Fanny went to her every two or three days:
it seemed a kind of fascination:
she could not be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without ever thinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had;
and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_ often at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected.
the weather being unusually mild for the time of year,
and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till,
in the midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on the sweets of so protracted an autumn, they were forced,
by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk for warmth.
;This is pretty, very pretty,; said Fanny, looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day;
;every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty.
Three years ago, this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field,
never thought of as anything,
or capable of becoming anything;
and now it is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament;
and perhaps, in another three years, we may be forgetting almost forgetting what it was before.
; And following the latter train of thought, she soon afterwards added:
;If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.
Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say;
and Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her own mind to what she thought must interest.
One does not think of extent here;
and between ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.;
In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety,
but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence.
You will think me rhapsodising;
but when I am out of doors, especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain.
An elegant, moderate sized house in the centre of family connexions;
continual engagements among them;
commanding the first society in the neighbourhood;
looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even more than those of larger fortune,
and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a _tete a tete_ with the person one feels most agreeable in the world.
;Come, come, it would be very un handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours.
Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing;
for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth's wife must be to fill her house, and give the best balls in the country.;
It was the first time of his seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance which he had been hearing of with great satisfaction.
A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:
and to the credit of the lover's understanding,
be it stated, that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship.
;Perhaps I might have scolded,; said Edmund, ;if either of you had been sitting down alone;
but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a great deal.;
But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on,
in any little manoeuvre against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with.
I have my alarms, but they are quite in a different quarter;
and if I could have altered the weather, you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time
for here are some of my plants which Robert _
will_ leave out because the nights are so mild,
and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a sudden change of weather,
a hard frost setting in all at once, taking everybody at least Robert by surprise, and I shall lose every one;
and what is worse, cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday,
because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep beyond to morrow.
These are something like grievances, and make me think the weather most unseasonably close.;
;Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live where we may;
and when you are settled in town and I come to see you,
I dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer,
perhaps on their very account.
Their remoteness and unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing forth bitter lamentations.;
;That is not much to the purpose now;
and as to my being in parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on.
No, Miss Crawford,; he added, in a more serious tone, ;there _are_ distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any chance
absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining
but they are of a different character.;
A look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford's side as she made some laughing answer, was sorrowfull food for Fanny's observation;
and finding herself quite unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now following the others,
she had nearly resolved on going home immediately,
and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock at Mansfield Park, striking three,
made her feel that she had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the previous self inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then, and how, to a very speedy issue.
With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus;
and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back.
Fanny's hurry increased;
and without in the least expecting Edmund's attendance, she would have hastened away alone;
but the general pace was quickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through which it was necessary to pass.
This was so new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of Fanny's life, that she was all surprise and embarrassment;
and while stammering out her great obligation, and her ;
but she did not suppose it would be in her power,;
was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help.
But Edmund, delighted with her having such an happiness offered,
and ascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence, that she had no objection but on her aunt's account,
could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her, and therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should be accepted;
and though Fanny would not venture, even on his encouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it was soon settled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might expect her.
The two cousins walked home together;
and, except in the immediate discussion of this engagement,
which Edmund spoke of with the warmest satisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk;
for having finished that subject, he grew thoughtful and indisposed for any other.
;If you put such a question to her,; cried Edmund, preventing his cousin's speaking, ;Fanny will immediately say No;
but I am sure, my dear mother, she would like to go;
and I can see no reason why she should not.;
but the subject involving, as it did, her own evening's comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram's mind,
that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing room,
she called him back again, when he had almost closed the door, with ;Sir Thomas, stop a moment
I have something to say to you.;
but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding,
and with very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her,
and at last decide against her, she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent.
Her cause, meanwhile, went on well.
It began, on Lady Bertram's part, with ;I have something to tell you that will surprise you.
Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.;
;Nothing can be more natural,; said Sir Thomas, after a short deliberation;
;nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything, in my opinion, be more natural.
Mrs. Grant's shewing civility to Miss Price, to Lady Bertram's niece, could never want explanation.
Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance in hers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dined out before;
and though now going only half a mile, and only to three people, still it was dining out, and all the little interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves.
She had neither sympathy nor assistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste;
for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody,
and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill humour, and seemed intent only on lessening her niece's pleasure, both present and future, as much as possible.
and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way, or ever dining out at all;
and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated.
Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come into her head,
and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia had been at home, you would not have been asked at all.;
Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant's part of the favour,
that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,
and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt's evening work in such a state as to prevent her being missed.
Had the doctor been contented to take my dining table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his own,
which is wider, literally wider than the dinner table here, how infinitely better it would have been!
;The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves,
makes me think it right to give _you_ a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us;
and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia.
Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last;
and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are not to be taking place of her.
;And if it should rain,
which I think exceedingly likely, for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage as well as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you.
I certainly do not go home to night,
and, therefore, the carriage will not be out on my account;
so you must make up your mind to what may happen, and take your things accordingly.;
;Walk! ; repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity,
and coming farther into the room.
;My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year!
;Yes, sir,; was Fanny's humble answer,
given with the feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris;
and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of the room,
having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation
She felt that the carriage was for herself, and herself alone:
and her uncle's consideration of her, coming immediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone.
The coachman drove round to a minute;
another minute brought down the gentleman;
and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being late, been many minutes seated in the drawing room,
Sir Thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.
There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very differently she felt;
but the idea of having such another to observe her was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing room.
In the drawing room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner;
and the smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing round him, shewed how welcome was his,
sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.
A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund;
and with the exception of Fanny, the pleasure was general;
and even to _her_ there might be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to.
She was soon aware of this herself;
for though she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite of her aunt Norris's opinion, to being the principal lady in company,
and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while they were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in which she was not required to take any part
and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day.
She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance of interest,
in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending for his hunters from Norfolk,
which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by Edmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters,
was soon in possession of his mind, and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on.
Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the open weather,
but her answers were as short and indifferent as civility allowed.
Her two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her thoughts on seeing him;
but no embarrassing remembrance affected his spirits.
Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before,
and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,
as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state.
when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them,
With a significant smile, which made Fanny quite hate him, he said, ;So!
Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton, I understand; happy man!;
Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two and forty speeches to her;; adding, with a momentary seriousness, ;She is too good for him much too good.
Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten,
your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part
in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied
to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own!
I think if we had had the disposal of events
if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two, about the equinox,
there would have been a difference.
He seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her face, said, with a firmer tone than usual, ;As far as I am concerned, sir, I would not have delayed his return for a day.
She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before,
and never so angrily to any one; a
nd when her speech was over, she trembled and blushed at her own daring.
He was surprised; but after a few moments' silent consideration of her, replied in a calmer, graver tone,
and as if the candid result of conviction, ;I believe you are right.
; And then turning the conversation, he would have engaged her on some other subject,
but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any.
Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother;
and as of course he will still live at home, it will be all for his _menus_ _plaisirs_;
and a sermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice.;
His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying, ;Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves.
Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to do and to suffer for it, which she could not think lightly of;
but she checked herself and let it pass;
and tried to look calm and unconcerned when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.
Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as I shall do not to lose a word;
or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful?
;I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,; said Edmund; ;
for you would be more likely to disconcert me,
and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.;
formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his attentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so
and Miss Crawford took her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen;
and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening,
The assurance of Edmund's being so soon to take orders,
coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended,
and still hoped uncertain and at a distance, was felt with resentment and mortification.
She _had_ begun to think of him;
she felt that she had, with great regard, with almost decided intentions;
but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings.
It was plain that he could have no serious views, no true attachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to.
Henry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the next morning to give another fortnight to Mansfield,
and having sent for his hunters, and written a few lines of explanation to the Admiral,
he looked round at his sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him,
and seeing the coast clear of the rest of the family, said, with a smile,
;And how do you think I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?
You see her every day, and therefore do not notice it;
but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn.
I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance;
but in that soft skin of hers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there is decided beauty;
and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express.
This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with,
and because she has got a new gown, and you never saw her so well dressed before.
I have always thought her pretty
not strikingly pretty
but 'pretty enough,' as people say;
a sort of beauty that grows on one.
Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile;
but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress,
and your having nobody else to look at;
and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty,
or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.;
I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy;
a _little_ love, perhaps, may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plunge her deep, for she is as good a little creature as ever lived,
and has a great deal of feeling.;
only want her to look kindly on me, to give me smiles as well as blushes,
to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talk to her;
to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions and pleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield,
and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again.
And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her fate, a fate which,
had not Fanny's heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she deserved;
for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen or one should not read about them as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent, manner, attention, and flattery can do,
I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them,
With all the security which love of another and disesteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking, his continued attentions continued,
but not obtrusive, and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her character obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly.
She had by no means forgotten the past, and she thought as ill of him as ever;
but she felt his powers: he was entertaining; and his manners were so improved, so polite, so seriously and blamelessly polite, that it was impossible not to be civil to him in return.
A very few days were enough to effect this;
and at the end of those few days, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her,
inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with everybody.
She had a letter from him herself, a few hurried happy lines,
written as the ship came up Channel, and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead;
and when Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand,
which he had hoped would bring the first tidings, he found her trembling with joy over this letter, and listening with a glowing,
grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply.
It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly master of the subject,
or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a brother, or his being in such a ship,
but the interest then excited had been very properly lively, determining him on his return to town to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp's return from the Mediterranean, etc.
the good luck which attended his early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her,
as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral, in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence, He proved, however, to be too late.
But his intention, the kindness of his intention, was thankfully acknowledged:
quite thankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William.
There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was still only a midshipman;
and as his parents, from living on the spot, must already have seen him, and be seeing him perhaps daily,
his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years,
and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement;
and accordingly the reply to her reply, fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as soon as possible;
and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner visit, when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature,
watching in the hall, in the lobby, on the stairs, for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother.
It came happily while she was thus waiting;
there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting, she was with him as he entered the house,
the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses
unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such.
This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at,
Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.
For Lucy had her work cut out for her.
The doors would be taken off their hinges
Rumpelmayer's men were coming.
what a morning
fresh as if issued to children on a beach.
What a lark!
What a plunge!
For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air.
How fresh
how calm
stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning
like the flap of a wave
the kiss of a wave
chill and sharp and yet for a girl of eighteen as she then was solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen
looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them
He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace Peter Walsh.
He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull
it was his sayings one remembered
his eyes, his pocket knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished
how strange it was!
a few sayings like this about cabbages.
She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass.
A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster
a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.
There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.
For having lived in Westminster
how many years now?
over twenty one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity
an indescribable pause
a suspense but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza before Big Ben strikes.
Out it boomed.
First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.
The leaden circles dissolved in the air.
Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street.
For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh
but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps drink their downfall do the same
can't be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason
they love life.
In people's eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge
in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs
in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved
life; London; this moment of June.
For it was the middle of June.
The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin
or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed
but it was over
thank Heaven over.
It was June.
And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it;
wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run;
and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery;
and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea green brooches in eighteenth century settings to tempt Americans
but one must economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth
and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate
to give her party.
But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence
the mist
the hum
the slow swimming happy ducks
the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread
her old friend Hugh
the admirable Hugh!
Where are you off to?
rather extravagantly, for they had known each other as children.
Good morning to you, Clarissa!
I love walking in London,
Really it's better than walking in the country.
They had just come up unfortunately to see doctors.
Other people came to see pictures
go to the opera
take their daughters out
the Whitbreads came
to see doctors.
Times without number Clarissa had visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home.
Ah yes
she did of course
what a nuisance
and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat.
Not the right hat for the early morning, was that it?
For Hugh always made her feel, as he bustled on, raising his hat rather extravagantly and assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen, and of course he was coming to her party to night,
Evelyn absolutely insisted,
only a little late he might be after the party at the Palace to which he had to take one of Jim's boys
she always felt a little skimpy beside Hugh
schoolgirlish
but attached to him, partly from having known him always, but she did think him a good sort in his own way, though Richard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him.
She could remember scene after scene at Bourton Peter furious; Hugh not, of course, his match in any way, but still not a positive imbecile as Peter made out
not a mere barber's block.
When his old mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to Bath he did it, without a word
he was really unselfish, and as for saying, as Peter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the manners and breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her dear Peter at his worst
and he could be intolerable
he could be impossible; but adorable to walk with on a morning like this.
June had drawn out every leaf on the trees.
The mothers of Pimlico gave suck to their young.
Messages were passing from the Fleet to the Admiralty.
Arlington Street and Piccadilly seemed to chafe the very air in the Park and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, on waves of that divine vitality which Clarissa loved.
To dance, to ride, she had adored all that.
For they might be parted for hundreds of years, she and Peter
she never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks
but suddenly it would come over her, If he were with me now what would he say?
some days, some sights bringing him back to her calmly, without the old bitterness
which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people
they came back in the middle of St. James's Park on a fine morning indeed they did.
But Peter however beautiful the day might be, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink Peter never saw a thing of all that.
He would put on his spectacles, if she told him to
he would look.
It was the state of the world that interested him
Wagner, Pope's poetry, people's characters eternally, and the defects of her own soul.
How he scolded her!
How they argued!
She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase; the perfect hostess he called her she had cried over it in her bedroom , she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said.
So she would still find herself arguing in St. James's Park, still making out that she had been right and she had too not to marry him.
For in marriage a little licence, a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house
which Richard gave her, and she him.
Where was he this morning for instance?
Some committee
she never asked what.
But with Peter everything had to be shared; everything gone into.
And it was intolerable, and when it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain, she had to break with him or they would have been destroyed, both of them ruined, she was convinced
though she had borne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart the grief, the anguish
and then the horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat going to India!
Never should she forget all that!
Cold, heartless, a prude, he called her.
Never could she understand how he cared.
But those Indian women did presumably silly, pretty, flimsy nincompoops.
And she wasted her pity.
For he was quite happy
he assured her
though he had never done a thing that they talked of
his whole life had been a failure.
It made her angry still.
She had reached the Park gates.
She stood for a moment, looking at the omnibuses in Piccadilly.
She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that.
She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.
She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on.
She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.
Not that she thought herself clever, or much out of the ordinary.
How she had got through life on the few twigs of knowledge Fraulein Daniels gave them she could not think.
She knew nothing
no language, no history
she scarcely read a book now, except memoirs in bed
and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing
all this; the cabs passing
and she would not say of Peter, she would not say of herself, I am this, I am that.
Her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct, she thought, walking on.
If you put her in a room with some one, up went her back like a cat's
or she purred.
Devonshire House, Bath House, the house with the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once
and remembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton such hosts of people
and dancing all night
and the waggons plodding past to market
and driving home across the Park.
She remembered once throwing a shilling into the Serpentine.
But every one remembered
what she loved was this, here, now, in front of her
the fat lady in the cab.
Did it matter then, she asked herself, walking towards Bond Street, did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely
all this must go on without her; did she resent it
or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely?
but that somehow in the streets of London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there, she survived, Peter survived, lived in each other, she being part, she was positive, of the trees at home
of the house there, ugly, rambling all to bits and pieces as it was
part of people she had never met
being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life, herself.
But what was she dreaming as she looked into Hatchards' shop window?
What was she trying to recover?
What image of white dawn in the country, as she read in the book spread open:
Fear no more the heat o' the sun
Nor the furious winter's rages.
This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears.
Tears and sorrows; courage and endurance
a perfectly upright and stoical bearing.
Think, for example, of the woman she admired most, Lady Bexborough, opening the bazaar.
There were Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities; there were Soapy Sponge and Mrs. Asquith's Memoirs and Big Game Shooting in Nigeria, all spread open.
Ever so many books there were
but none that seemed exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread in her nursing home.
Nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried up little woman look, as Clarissa came in, just for a moment cordial; before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women's ailments.
How much she wanted it that people should look pleased as she came in, Clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards Bond Street, annoyed, because it was silly to have other reasons for doing things.
Much rather would she have been one of those people like Richard who did things for themselves, whereas, she thought, waiting to cross, half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves
but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew and now the policeman held up his hand for no one was ever for a second taken in.
Oh if she could have had her life over again!
she thought, stepping on to the pavement, could have looked even differently!
She would have been, in the first place, dark like Lady Bexborough, with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes.
She would have been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately
rather large
interested in politics like a man
with a country house
very dignified, very sincere.
Instead of which she had a narrow pea stick figure
a ridiculous little face, beaked like a bird's.
That she held herself well was true
and had nice hands and feet
and dressed well, considering that she spent little.
But often now this body she wore she stopped to look at a Dutch picture , this body, with all its capacities, seemed nothing nothing at all.
She had the oddest sense of being herself invisible
unseen
unknown
there being no more marrying
no more having of children now
but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street, this being Mrs. Dalloway
not even Clarissa any more
this being Mrs. Richard Dalloway.
Bond Street fascinated her
Bond Street early in the morning in the season
its flags flying
its shops
no splash
no glitter
one roll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for fifty years
a few pearls
salmon on an iceblock.
That is all,
she said, looking at the fishmonger's.
And her old Uncle William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves.
He had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the War.
I have had enough.
Gloves and shoes
she had a passion for gloves
but her own daughter, her Elizabeth, cared not a straw for either of them.
Not a straw, she thought, going on up Bond Street to a shop where they kept flowers for her when she gave a party.
Elizabeth really cared for her dog most of all.
The whole house this morning smelt of tar.
Still, better poor Grizzle than Miss Kilman
better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book!
Better anything, she was inclined to say.
But it might be only a phase, as Richard said, such as all girls go through.
It might be falling in love.
But why with Miss Kilman?
who had been badly treated of course
one must make allowances for that, and Richard said she was very able, had a really historical mind.
Anyhow they were inseparable, and Elizabeth, her own daughter, went to Communion; and how she dressed, how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a bit
it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people callous so did causes
dulled their feelings, for Miss Kilman would do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians
but in private inflicted positive torture, so insensitive was she, dressed in a green mackintosh coat.
Year in year out she wore that coat
she perspired
she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority, your inferiority
how poor she was
how rich you were
how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it, her dismissal from school during the War poor embittered unfortunate creature!
For it was not her one hated but the idea of her, which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not Miss Kilman
he had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night; one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life blood, dominators and tyrants
for no doubt with another throw of the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she would have loved Miss Kilman!
But not in this world.
It rasped her, though, to have stirring about in her this brutal monster!
to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf encumbered forest, the soul
never to be content quite, or quite secure, for at any moment the brute would be stirring, this hatred, which, especially since her illness, had power to make her feel scraped, hurt in her spine
gave her physical pain, and made all pleasure in beauty, in friendship, in being well, in being loved and making her home delightful rock, quiver, and bend as if indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots
as if the whole panoply of content were nothing but self love!
this hatred!
Nonsense, nonsense! she cried to herself, pushing through the swing doors of Mulberry's the florists.
She advanced, light, tall, very upright, to be greeted at once by button faced Miss Pym, whose hands were always bright red, as if they had been stood in cold water with the flowers.
There were flowers
delphiniums, sweet peas, bunches of lilac; and carnations, masses of carnations.
There were roses
there were irises.
Ah yes
so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood talking to Miss Pym who owed her help, and thought her kind, for kind she had been years ago
very kind, but she looked older, this year, turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed, snuffing in, after the street uproar, the delicious scent, the exquisite coolness.
And then, opening her eyes, how fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked
and dark and prim the red carnations, holding their heads up
and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow white, pale
as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer's day, with its almost blue black sky, its delphiniums, its carnations, its arum lilies was over
and it was the moment between six and seven when every flower roses, carnations, irises, lilac glows
white, violet, red, deep orange
every flower seems to burn by itself, softly, purely in the misty beds
and how she loved the grey white moths spinning in and out, over the cherry pie, over the evening primroses!
And as she began to go with Miss Pym from jar to jar, choosing, nonsense, nonsense, she said to herself, more and more gently, as if this beauty, this scent, this colour, and Miss Pym liking her, trusting her, were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount that hatred, that monster, surmount it all
and it lifted her up and up when oh!
a pistol shot in the street outside!
Dear, those motor cars, said Miss Pym, going to the window to look, and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full of sweet peas, as if those motor cars, those tyres of motor cars, were all HER fault.
The violent explosion which made Mrs. Dalloway jump and Miss Pym go to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn to the side of the pavement precisely opposite Mulberry's shop window.
Passers by who, of course, stopped and stared, had just time to see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove grey upholstery, before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen except a square of dove grey.
Yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of Bond Street to Oxford Street on one side, to Atkinson's scent shop on the other, passing invisibly, inaudibly, like a cloud, swift, veil like upon hills, falling indeed with something of a cloud's sudden sobriety and stillness upon faces which a second before had been utterly disorderly.
But now mystery had brushed them with her wing; they had heard the voice of authority; the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide.
But nobody knew whose face had been seen.
Was it the Prince of Wales's, the Queen's, the Prime Minister's?
Whose face was it?
Nobody knew.
Edgar J. Watkiss, with his roll of lead piping round his arm, said audibly
humorously of course
Septimus Warren Smith, who found himself unable to pass, heard him.
Septimus Warren Smith, aged about thirty, pale faced, beak nosed, wearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat, with hazel eyes which had that look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers apprehensive too.
The world has raised its whip
where will it descend?
Everything had come to a standstill.
The throb of the motor engines sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire body.
The sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped outside Mulberry's shop window
old ladies on the tops of omnibuses spread their black parasols
here a green, here a red parasol opened with a little pop.
Mrs. Dalloway, coming to the window with her arms full of sweet peas, looked out with her little pink face pursed in enquiry.
Every one looked at the motor car.
Septimus looked.
Boys on bicycles sprang off.
Traffic accumulated.
And there the motor car stood, with drawn blinds, and upon them a curious pattern like a tree, Septimus thought, and this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames, terrified him.
The world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames.
It is I who am blocking the way, he thought.
Was he not being looked at and pointed at; was he not weighted there, rooted to the pavement, for a purpose?
But for what purpose?
Let us go on
said his wife, a little woman, with large eyes in a sallow pointed face; an Italian girl.
But Lucrezia herself could not help looking at the motor car and the tree pattern on the blinds.
Was it the Queen in there
the Queen going shopping?
The chauffeur, who had been opening something, turning something, shutting something, got on to the box.
Come on, said Lucrezia.
But her husband, for they had been married four, five years now, jumped, started
People must notice
people must see.
People, she thought, looking at the crowd staring at the motor car
she admired
an awful thing to say.
Suppose they had heard him?
She looked at the crowd.
Help, help!
she wanted to cry out to butchers' boys and women.
Only last autumn she and Septimus had stood on the Embankment wrapped in the same cloak and, Septimus reading a paper instead of talking, she had snatched it from him and laughed in the old man's face who saw them!
But failure one conceals.
She must take him away into some park.
Now we will cross, she said.
She had a right to his arm
though it was without feeling.
He would give her, who was so simple, so impulsive, only twenty four,
without friends in England,
who had left Italy for his sake, a piece of bone.
The motor car with its blinds drawn and an air of inscrutable reserve proceeded towards Piccadilly, still gazed at, still ruffling the faces on both sides of the street with the same dark breath of veneration whether for Queen, Prince, or Prime Minister nobody knew.
The face itself had been seen only once by three people for a few seconds.
Even the sex was now in dispute.
But there could be no doubt that greatness was seated within;
greatness was passing, hidden, down Bond Street, removed only by a hand's breadth from ordinary people who might now, for the first and last time, be within speaking distance of the majesty of England, of the enduring symbol of the state which will be known to curious antiquaries, sifting the ruins of time, when London is a grass grown path and all those hurrying along the pavement this Wednesday morning are but bones with a few wedding rings mixed up in their dust and the gold stoppings of innumerable decayed teeth.
The face in the motor car will then be known.
It is probably the Queen, thought Mrs. Dalloway, coming out of Mulberry's with her flowers; the Queen.
And for a second she wore a look of extreme dignity standing by the flower shop in the sunlight while the car passed at a foot's pace, with its blinds drawn.
The Queen going to some hospital
the Queen opening some bazaar, thought Clarissa.
The crush was terrific for the time of day.
Lords, Ascot, Hurlingham, what was it? she wondered
for the street was blocked.
The British middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of omnibuses with parcels and umbrellas, yes, even furs on a day like this, were, she thought, more ridiculous, more unlike anything there has ever been than one could conceive
and the Queen herself held up; the Queen herself unable to pass.
Clarissa was suspended on one side of Brook Street
Sir John Buckhurst, the old Judge on the other, with the car between them Sir John had laid down the law for years and liked a well dressed woman when the chauffeur, leaning ever so slightly, said or showed something to the policeman, who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head and moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through.
Slowly and very silently it took its way.
Clarissa guessed
Clarissa knew of course;
she had seen something white, magical, circular, in the footman's hand, a disc inscribed with a name the Queen's, the Prince of Wales's, the Prime Minister's?
which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way through Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing , to blaze among candelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves, Hugh Whitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England, that night in Buckingham Palace.
And Clarissa, too, gave a party.
She stiffened a little;
so she would stand at the top of her stairs.
The car had gone, but it had left a slight ripple which flowed through glove shops and hat shops and tailors' shops on both sides of Bond Street.
For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same way to the window.
Choosing a pair of gloves should they be to the elbow or above it, lemon or pale grey?
ladies stopped;
when the sentence was finished something had happened.
Something so trifling in single instances that no mathematical instrument, though capable of transmitting shocks in China, could register the vibration;
yet in its fulness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional;
for in all the hat shops and tailors' shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the dead; of the flag; of Empire.
In a public house in a back street a Colonial insulted the House of Windsor which led to words, broken beer glasses, and a general shindy, which echoed strangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white underlinen threaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings.
For the surface agitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very profound.
Gliding across Piccadilly, the car turned down St. James's Street.
Tall men, men of robust physique, well dressed men with their tail coats and their white slips and their hair raked back who, for reasons difficult to discriminate, were standing in the bow window of Brooks's with their hands behind the tails of their coats, looking out, perceived instinctively that greatness was passing, and the pale light of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon Clarissa Dalloway.
At once they stood even straighter, and removed their hands, and seemed ready to attend their Sovereign, if need be, to the cannon's mouth,
as their ancestors had done before them.
The white busts and the little tables in the background covered with copies of the Tatler and syphons of soda water seemed to approve;
seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of England;
and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls of a whispering gallery return a single voice expanded and made sonorous by the might of a whole cathedral.
Shawled Moll Pratt with her flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well it was the Prince of Wales for certain and would have tossed the price of a pot of beer a bunch of roses into St. James's Street out of sheer light heartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the constable's eye upon her, discouraging an old Irishwoman's loyalty.
The sentries at St. James's saluted; Queen Alexandra's policeman approved.
A small crowd meanwhile had gathered at the gates of Buckingham Palace.
Listlessly, yet confidently, poor people all of them, they waited;
looked at the Palace itself with the flag flying;
at Victoria, billowing on her mound, admired her shelves of running water, her geraniums;
singled out from the motor cars in the Mall first this one, then that;
bestowed emotion, vainly, upon commoners out for a drive;
recalled their tribute to keep it unspent while this car passed and that;
and all the time let rumour accumulate in their veins and thrill the nerves in their thighs at the thought of Royalty looking at them;
the Queen bowing;
the Prince saluting;
at the thought of the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon Kings;
of the equerries and deep curtsies;
of the Queen's old doll's house;
of Princess Mary married to an Englishman, and the Prince ah!
the Prince!
who took wonderfully, they said, after old King Edward
but was ever so much slimmer.
The Prince lived at St. James's
but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother.
So Sarah Bletchley said with her baby in her arms, tipping her foot up and down as though she were by her own fender in Pimlico
but keeping her eyes on the Mall, while Emily Coates ranged over the Palace windows and thought of the housemaids, the innumerable housemaids, the bedrooms, the innumerable bedrooms.
Joined by an elderly gentleman with an Aberdeen terrier, by men without occupation, the crowd increased.
Little Mr. Bowley, who had rooms in the Albany and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life but could be unsealed suddenly, inappropriately, sentimentally, by this sort of thing poor women waiting to see the Queen go past poor women, nice little children, orphans, widows, the War tut tut actually had tears in his eyes.
A breeze flaunting ever so warmly down the Mall through the thin trees, past the bronze heroes, lifted some flag flying in the British breast of Mr. Bowley and he raised his hat as the car turned into the Mall and held it high as the car approached
and let the poor mothers of Pimlico press close to him, and stood very upright.
The car came on.
Suddenly Mrs. Coates looked up into the sky.
The sound of an aeroplane bored ominously into the ears of the crowd.
There it was coming over the trees, letting out white smoke from behind, which curled and twisted, actually writing something!
Every one looked up.
Dropping dead down the aeroplane soared straight up
It curved in a loop
It raced
It sank
It rose
murmured Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleep walker.
With his hat held out perfectly still in his hand, Mr. Bowley gazed straight up.
All down the Mall people were standing and looking up into the sky.
As they looked the whole world became perfectly silent, and a flight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading
then another, and in this extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor, in this purity, bells struck eleven times, the sound fading up there among the gulls.
It had gone
it was behind the clouds.
There was no sound.
a mission of the greatest importance.
Then suddenly, as a train comes out of a tunnel, the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds again, the sound boring into the ears of all people in the Mall, in the Green Park, in Piccadilly, in Regent Street, in Regent's Park, and the bar of smoke curved behind and it dropped down, and it soared up and wrote one letter after another
but what word was it writing?
Lucrezia Warren Smith, sitting by her husband's side on a seat in Regent's Park in the Broad Walk, looked up.
Look, look, Septimus!
For Dr. Holmes had told her to make her husband who had nothing whatever seriously the matter with him but was a little out of sorts take an interest in things outside himself.
So, thought Septimus, looking up, they are signalling to me.
Not indeed in actual words; that is, he could not read the language yet
but it was plain enough
this beauty, this exquisite beauty, and tears filled his eyes as he looked at the smoke words languishing and melting in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible charity and laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable beauty and signalling their intention to provide him, for nothing, for ever, for looking merely, with beauty, more beauty!
Tears ran down his cheeks.
It was toffee
they were advertising toffee
a nursemaid told Rezia.
Together they began to spell
Septimus heard her say close to his ear
deeply, softly, like a mellow organ, but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper's, which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound which, concussing, broke.
A marvellous discovery indeed that the human voice in certain atmospheric conditions for one must be scientific, above all scientific can quicken trees into life!
Happily Rezia put her hand with a tremendous weight on his knee so that he was weighted down, transfixed, or the excitement of the elm trees rising and falling, rising and falling with all their leaves alight and the colour thinning and thickening from blue to the green of a hollow wave, like plumes on horses' heads, feathers on ladies', so proudly they rose and fell, so superbly, would have sent him mad.
But he would not go mad.
He would shut his eyes; he would see no more.
But they beckoned; leaves were alive; trees were alive.
And the leaves being connected by millions of fibres with his own body, there on the seat, fanned it up and down; when the branch stretched he, too, made that statement.
The sparrows fluttering, rising, and falling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern;
the white and blue, barred with black branches.
Sounds made harmonies with premeditation;
the spaces between them were as significant as the sounds.
A child cried.
Rightly far away a horn sounded.
All taken together meant the birth of a new religion 
Septimus! said Rezia.
He started violently.
People must notice.
I am going to walk to the fountain and back,
For she could stand it no longer.
Dr. Holmes might say there was nothing the matter.
Far rather would she that he were dead!
She could not sit beside him when he stared so and did not see her and made everything terrible
sky and tree, children playing, dragging carts, blowing whistles, falling down
all were terrible.
And he would not kill himself
and she could tell no one.
Septimus has been working too hard that was all she could say to her own mother.
To love makes one solitary, she thought.
She could tell nobody, not even Septimus now, and looking back, she saw him sitting in his shabby overcoat alone, on the seat, hunched up, staring.
And it was cowardly for a man to say he would kill himself
but Septimus had fought
he was brave
he was not Septimus now.
She put on her lace collar.
She put on her new hat and he never noticed;
and he was happy without her.
Nothing could make her happy without him!
Nothing!
He was selfish.
So men are.
For he was not ill.
Dr. Holmes said there was nothing the matter with him.
She spread her hand before her.
Look!
Her wedding ring slipped
she had grown so thin.
It was she who suffered
but she had nobody to tell.
Far was Italy and the white houses and the room where her sisters sat making hats
and the streets crowded every evening with people walking
laughing out loud, not half alive like people here, huddled up in Bath chairs, looking at a few ugly flowers stuck in pots!
For you should see the Milan gardens,
she said aloud.
But to whom?
There was nobody.
Her words faded.
So a rocket fades.
Its sparks, having grazed their way into the night, surrender to it, dark descends, pours over the outlines of houses and towers
bleak hillsides soften and fall in.
But though they are gone, the night is full of them
robbed of colour, blank of windows, they exist more ponderously, give out what the frank daylight fails to transmit
the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness;
huddled together in the darkness;
reft of the relief which dawn brings when, washing the walls white and grey, spotting each window pane, lifting the mist from the fields, showing the red brown cows peacefully grazing
all is once more decked out to the eye;
exists again.
I am alone
I am alone!
she cried, by the fountain in Regent's Park staring at the Indian and his cross
as perhaps at midnight, when all boundaries are lost, the country reverts to its ancient shape
as the Romans saw it, lying cloudy, when they landed, and the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where
such was her darkness
when suddenly, as if a shelf were shot forth and she stood on it, she said how she was his wife, married years ago in Milan, his wife, and would never, never tell that he was mad!
Turning, the shelf fell; down, down she dropped.
For he was gone, she thought gone, as he threatened, to kill himself to throw himself under a cart!
But no; there he was;
still sitting alone on the seat, in his shabby overcoat, his legs crossed, staring, talking aloud.
Men must not cut down trees.
There is a God.
He noted such revelations on the backs of envelopes.
Change the world.
No one kills from hatred.
Make it known
he wrote it down .
He waited.
A sparrow perched on the railing opposite chirped Septimus, Septimus, four or five times over and went on, drawing its notes out, to sing freshly and piercingly in Greek words how there is no crime and, joined by another sparrow, they sang in voices prolonged and piercing in Greek words, from trees in the meadow of life beyond a river where the dead walk, how there is no death.
There was his hand
there the dead.
White things were assembling behind the railings opposite.
But he dared not look.
Evans was behind the railings!
What are you saying? said Rezia suddenly, sitting down by him.
Interrupted again!
She was always interrupting.
Away from people they must get away from people, he said jumping up , right away over there, where there were chairs beneath a tree and the long slope of the park dipped like a length of green stuff with a ceiling cloth of blue and pink smoke high above, and there was a rampart of far irregular houses hazed in smoke, the traffic hummed in a circle, and on the right, dun coloured animals stretched long necks over the Zoo palings, barking, howling.
There they sat down under a tree.
Look, she implored him, pointing at a little troop of boys carrying cricket stumps, and one shuffled, spun round on his heel and shuffled, as if he were acting a clown at the music hall.
Look, she implored him
for Dr. Holmes had told her to make him notice real things, go to a music hall, play cricket that was the very game, Dr. Holmes said, a nice out of door game, the very game for her husband.
Look, she repeated.
Look the unseen bade him, the voice which now communicated with him who was the greatest of mankind, Septimus, lately taken from life to death, the Lord who had come to renew society, who lay like a coverlet, a snow blanket smitten only by the sun, for ever unwasted, suffering for ever, the scapegoat, the eternal sufferer
but he did not want it, he moaned, putting from him with a wave of his hand that eternal suffering, that eternal loneliness.
for he must not talk aloud to himself out of doors.
Look, she repeated
But what was there to look at?
A few sheep.
That was all.
Oh look, she implored him.
The way to Regent's Park Tube station could they tell her the way to Regent's Park Tube station
Maisie Johnson wanted to know.
She was only up from Edinburgh two days ago.
Not this way over there!
waving her aside, lest she should see Septimus.
Rezia exclaimed,
Both seemed queer, Maisie Johnson thought.
Everything seemed very queer.
In London for the first time, come to take up a post at her uncle's in Leadenhall Street
and now walking through Regent's Park in the morning, this couple on the chairs gave her quite a turn
the young woman seeming foreign, the man looking queer
so that should she be very old she would still remember and make it jangle again among her memories how she had walked through Regent's Park on a fine summer's morning fifty years ago.
For she was only nineteen and had got her way at last, to come to London;
and now how queer it was, this couple she had asked the way of, and the girl started and jerked her hand, and the man he seemed awfully odd;
quarrelling, perhaps;
parting for ever, perhaps;
something was up, she knew;
and now all these people for she returned to the Broad Walk , the stone basins, the prim flowers, the old men and women, invalids most of them in Bath chairs all seemed, after Edinburgh, so queer.
And Maisie Johnson, as she joined that gently trudging, vaguely gazing, breeze kissed company squirrels perching and preening, sparrow fountains fluttering for crumbs, dogs busy with the railings, busy with each other, while the soft warm air washed over them and lent to the fixed unsurprised gaze with which they received life something whimsical and mollified Maisie Johnson positively felt she must cry Oh!
for that young man on the seat had given her quite a turn.
Something was up, she knew.
Horror! she wanted to cry.
horror!
She had left her people;
they had warned her what would happen.
Why hadn't she stayed at home?
she cried, twisting the knob of the iron railing.
That girl, thought Mrs. Dempster who saved crusts for the squirrels and often ate her lunch in Regent's Park , don't know a thing yet;
and really it seemed to her better to be a little stout, a little slack, a little moderate in one's expectations.
Percy drank.
Well, better to have a son, thought Mrs. Dempster.
She had had a hard time of it, and couldn't help smiling at a girl like that.
You'll get married, for you're pretty enough, thought Mrs. Dempster.
Get married, she thought, and then you'll know.
Oh, the cooks, and so on.
Every man has his ways.
But whether I'd have chosen quite like that if I could have known, thought Mrs. Dempster, and could not help wishing to whisper a word to Maisie Johnson
to feel on the creased pouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity.
For it's been a hard life, thought Mrs. Dempster.
What hadn't she given to it?
Roses; figure; her feet too.
She drew the knobbed lumps beneath her skirt.
Roses, she thought sardonically.
All trash, m'dear.
For really, what with eating, drinking, and mating, the bad days and good, life had been no mere matter of roses, and what was more, let me tell you, Carrie Dempster had no wish to change her lot with any woman's in Kentish Town!
But, she implored, pity.
Pity, for the loss of roses.
Pity she asked of Maisie Johnson, standing by the hyacinth beds.
but that aeroplane!
Hadn't Mrs. Dempster always longed to see foreign parts?
She had a nephew, a missionary.
It soared and shot.
She always went on the sea at Margate, not out o' sight of land
but she had no patience with women who were afraid of water.
It swept and fell.
Her stomach was in her mouth.
Up again.
There's a fine young feller aboard of it, Mrs. Dempster wagered, and away and away it went, fast and fading, away and away the aeroplane shot;
soaring over Greenwich and all the masts; over the little island of grey churches, St. Paul's and the rest till, on either side of London, fields spread out and dark brown woods where adventurous thrushes hopping boldly, glancing quickly, snatched the snail and tapped him on a stone, once, twice, thrice.
Away and away the aeroplane shot, till it was nothing but a bright spark; an aspiration; a concentration;
a symbol so it seemed to Mr. Bentley, vigorously rolling his strip of turf at Greenwich of man's soul;
of his determination, thought Mr. Bentley, sweeping round the cedar tree, to get outside his body, beyond his house, by means of thought, Einstein, speculation, mathematics, the Mendelian theory away the aeroplane shot.
Then, while a seedy looking nondescript man carrying a leather bag stood on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral, and hesitated, for within was what balm, how great a welcome, how many tombs with banners waving over them, tokens of victories not over armies, but over, he thought, that plaguy spirit of truth seeking which leaves me at present without a situation, and more than that, the cathedral offers company, he thought, invites you to membership of a society;
great men belong to it; martyrs have died for it;
why not enter in, he thought, put this leather bag stuffed with pamphlets before an altar, a cross, the symbol of something which has soared beyond seeking and questing and knocking of words together and has become all spirit, disembodied, ghostly why not enter in?
he thought and while he hesitated out flew the aeroplane over Ludgate Circus.
It was strange;
it was still.
Not a sound was to be heard above the traffic.
Unguided it seemed;
sped of its own free will.
The hall of the house was cool as a vault.
Mrs. Dalloway raised her hand to her eyes, and, as the maid shut the door to, and she heard the swish of Lucy's skirts, she felt like a nun who has left the world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the response to old devotions.
The cook whistled in the kitchen.
She heard the click of the typewriter.
It was her life
and, bending her head over the hall table, she bowed beneath the influence, felt blessed and purified, saying to herself, as she took the pad with the telephone message on it, how moments like this are buds on the tree of life, flowers of darkness they are, she thought
as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only
not for a moment did she believe in God;
but all the more, she thought, taking up the pad, must one repay in daily life to servants, yes, to dogs and canaries, above all to Richard her husband, who was the foundation of it of the gay sounds, of the green lights, of the cook even whistling, for Mrs. Walker was Irish and whistled all day long one must pay back from this secret deposit of exquisite moments, she thought, lifting the pad, while Lucy stood by her, trying to explain how Mr. Dalloway, ma'am
Clarissa read on the telephone pad, Lady Bruton wishes to know if Mr. Dalloway will lunch with her to day.
Mr. Dalloway, ma'am, told me to tell you he would be lunching out.
Dear! said Clarissa
and Lucy shared as she meant her to her disappointment
but not the pang
felt the concord between them;
took the hint;
thought how the gentry love;
gilded her own future with calm;
and, taking Mrs. Dalloway's parasol, handled it like a sacred weapon which a Goddess, having acquitted herself honourably in the field of battle, sheds, and placed it in the umbrella stand.
Fear no more, said Clarissa.
Fear no more the heat o' the sun;
for the shock of Lady Bruton asking Richard to lunch without her made the moment in which she had stood shiver,
as a plant on the river bed feels the shock of a passing oar and shivers
so she rocked
so she shivered.
Millicent Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.
No vulgar jealousy could separate her from Richard.
But she feared time itself, and read on Lady Bruton's face
as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone, the dwindling of life;
how year by year her share was sliced
how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching, of absorbing, as in the youthful years, the colours, salts, tones of existence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing room, an exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which threaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl.
She put the pad on the hall table.
She began to go slowly upstairs, with her hand on the bannisters, as if she had left a party, where now this friend now that had flashed back her face, her voice
had shut the door and gone out and stood alone, a single figure against the appalling night, or rather, to be accurate, against the stare of this matter of fact June morning;
soft with the glow of rose petals for some, she knew, and felt it, as she paused by the open staircase window which let in blinds flapping, dogs barking, let in, she thought, feeling herself suddenly shrivelled, aged, breastless, the grinding, blowing, flowering of the day, out of doors, out of the window
out of her body and brain which now failed, since Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.
Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom.
There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping.
There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room.
Women must put off their rich apparel.
At midday they must disrobe.
She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed.
The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side.
Narrower and narrower would her bed be.
The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot's Memoirs.
She had read late at night of the retreat from Moscow.
For the House sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed.
And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow.
He knew it.
So the room was an attic
the bed narrow
and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet.
Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment for example on the river beneath the woods at Clieveden when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him.
And then at Constantinople, and again and again.
She could see what she lacked.
It was not beauty
it was not mind.
It was something central which permeated
something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.
For THAT she could dimly perceive.
She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature who is invariably wise ;
yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly.
And whether it was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident like a faint scent, or a violin next door so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments , she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt.
Only for a moment
but it was enough.
It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer
swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores!
Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination
a match burning in a crocus
an inner meaning almost expressed.
But the close withdrew
the hard softened.
It was over
the moment.
Against such moments with women too there contrasted as she laid her hat down the bed and Baron Marbot and the candle half burnt.
Lying awake, the floor creaked
the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his socks
and then, as often as not, dropped his hot water bottle and swore!
How she laughed!
But this question of love she thought, putting her coat away , this falling in love with women.
Take Sally Seton
her relation in the old days with Sally Seton.
Had not that, after all, been love?
She sat on the floor
that was her first impression of Sally
she sat on the floor with her arms round her knees, smoking a cigarette.
Where could it have been?
The Mannings?
The Kinloch Jones's?
At some party where, she could not be certain , for she had a distinct recollection of saying to the man she was with, Who is THAT?
And he had told her, and said that Sally's parents did not get on how that shocked her that one's parents should quarrel! .
But all that evening she could not take her eyes off Sally.
It was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired, dark, large eyed, with that quality which, since she hadn't got it herself, she always envied
a sort of abandonment, as if she could say anything, do anything
a quality much commoner in foreigners than in Englishwomen.
Sally always said she had French blood in her veins, an ancestor had been with Marie Antoinette, had his head cut off, left a ruby ring.
Perhaps that summer she came to stay at Bourton, walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket, one night after dinner, and upsetting poor Aunt Helena to such an extent that she never forgave her.
There had been some quarrel at home.
She literally hadn't a penny that night when she came to them
she had pawned a brooch to come down.
She had rushed off in a passion.
They sat up till all hours of the night talking.
Sally it was who made her feel, for the first time, how sheltered the life at Bourton was.
She knew nothing about sex nothing about social problems.
She had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field she had seen cows just after their calves were born.
But Aunt Helena never liked discussion of anything when Sally gave her William Morris, it had to be wrapped in brown paper .
There they sat, hour after hour, talking in her bedroom at the top of the house, talking about life, how they were to reform the world.
They meant to found a society to abolish private property, and actually had a letter written, though not sent out.
The ideas were Sally's, of course but very soon she was just as excited read Plato in bed before breakfast; read Morris; read Shelley by the hour.
Sally's power was amazing, her gift, her personality.
There was her way with flowers, for instance.
At Bourton they always had stiff little vases all the way down the table.
Sally went out, picked hollyhocks, dahlias all sorts of flowers that had never been seen together cut their heads off, and made them swim on the top of water in bowls.
The effect was extraordinary coming in to dinner in the sunset.
Of course Aunt Helena thought it wicked to treat flowers like that.
Then she forgot her sponge, and ran along the passage naked.
That grim old housemaid, Ellen Atkins, went about grumbling Suppose any of the gentlemen had seen?
Indeed she did shock people.
She was untidy, Papa said.
The strange thing, on looking back, was the purity, the integrity, of her feeling for Sally.
It was not like one's feeling for a man.
It was completely disinterested,
and besides, it had a quality which could only exist between women, between women just grown up.
It was protective, on her side;
sprang from a sense of being in league together, a presentiment of something that was bound to part them they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe , which led to this chivalry, this protective feeling which was much more on her side than Sally's.
For in those days she was completely reckless;
did the most idiotic things out of bravado;
bicycled round the parapet on the terrace;
smoked cigars.
Absurd, she was very absurd.
But the charm was overpowering, to her at least, so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot water can in her hands and saying aloud, She is beneath this roof....
She is beneath this roof!
No, the words meant absolutely nothing to her now.
She could not even get an echo of her old emotion.
But she could remember going cold with excitement, and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy now the old feeling began to come back to her, as she took out her hairpins, laid them on the dressing table, began to do her hair , with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light, and dressing, and going downstairs, and feeling as she crossed the hall if it were now to die 'twere now to be most happy.
That was her feeling Othello's feeling, and she felt it, she was convinced, as strongly as Shakespeare meant Othello to feel it, all because she was coming down to dinner in a white frock to meet Sally Seton!
She was wearing pink gauze
was that possible?
She SEEMED, anyhow, all light, glowing, like some bird or air ball that has flown in, attached itself for a moment to a bramble.
But nothing is so strange when one is in love
and what was this except being in love?
as the complete indifference of other people.
Aunt Helena just wandered off after dinner
Papa read the paper.
Peter Walsh might have been there, and old Miss Cummings
Joseph Breitkopf certainly was, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks and weeks, and pretended to read German with her, but really played the piano and sang Brahms without any voice.
All this was only a background for Sally.
She stood by the fireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be attracted rather against his will he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace
when suddenly she said, What a shame to sit indoors!
and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down.
Peter Walsh and Joseph Breitkopf went on about Wagner.
She and Sally fell a little behind.
Then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it.
Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the lips.
The whole world might have turned upside down!
The others disappeared
there she was alone with Sally.
And she felt that she had been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not to look at it
a diamond, something infinitely precious, wrapped up, which, as they walked up and down, up and down , she uncovered, or the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling!
when old Joseph and Peter faced them:
Star gazing? said Peter.
It was like running one's face against a granite wall in the darkness!
It was shocking; it was horrible!
Not for herself.
She felt only how Sally was being mauled already, maltreated
she felt his hostility
his jealousy; his determination to break into their companionship.
All this she saw as one sees a landscape in a flash of lightning and Sally
never had she admired her so much!
gallantly taking her way unvanquished.
She made old Joseph tell her the names of the stars, which he liked doing very seriously.
She stood there: she listened.
She heard the names of the stars.
Oh this horror! she said to herself
as if she had known all along that something would interrupt, would embitter her moment of happiness.
Yet, after all, how much she owed to him later.
Always when she thought of him she thought of their quarrels for some reason
because she wanted his good opinion so much, perhaps.
She owed him words: sentimental, civilised
they started up every day of her life
as if he guarded her.
A book was sentimental
an attitude to life sentimental.
Sentimental, perhaps she was to be thinking of the past.
What would he think, she wondered, when he came back?
That she had grown older?
Would he say that, or would she see him thinking when he came back, that she had grown older?
It was true.
Since her illness she had turned almost white.
Laying her brooch on the table, she had a sudden spasm, as if, while she mused, the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her.
She was not old yet.
She had just broken into her fifty second year.
Months and months of it were still untouched.
June, July, August!
Each still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the falling drop, Clarissa crossing to the dressing table plunged into the very heart of the moment, transfixed it, there the moment of this June morning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings, seeing the glass, the dressing table, and all the bottles afresh, collecting the whole of her at one point as she looked into the glass , seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a party;
of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself.
How many million times she had seen her face, and always with the same imperceptible contraction!
She pursed her lips when she looked in the glass.
It was to give her face point.
That was her self
pointed; dartlike; definite.
That was her self when some effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together
she alone knew how different, how incompatible and composed so for the world only into one centre
one diamond, one woman who sat in her drawing room and made a meeting point, a radiancy no doubt in some dull lives, a refuge for the lonely to come to, perhaps;
she had helped young people, who were grateful to her;
had tried to be the same always,
never showing a sign of all the other sides of her faults, jealousies, vanities, suspicions, like this of Lady Bruton not asking her to lunch;
which, she thought combing her hair finally , is utterly base!
Now, where was her dress?
Her evening dresses hung in the cupboard.
Clarissa, plunging her hand into the softness, gently detached the green dress and carried it to the window.
She had torn it.
Some one had trod on the skirt.
She had felt it give at the Embassy party at the top among the folds.
By artificial light the green shone, but lost its colour now in the sun.
She would mend it.
Her maids had too much to do.
She would wear it to night.
She would take her silks, her scissors,
what was it?
her thimble, of course, down into the drawing room, for she must also write, and see that things generally were more or less in order.
Strange, she thought, pausing on the landing, and assembling that diamond shape, that single person, strange how a mistress knows the very moment, the very temper of her house!
Faint sounds rose in spirals up the well of the stairs; the swish of a mop; tapping; knocking;
a loudness when the front door opened;
a voice repeating a message in the basement;
the chink of silver on a tray; clean silver for the party.
All was for the party.
And Lucy, coming into the drawing room with her tray held out, put the giant candlesticks on the mantelpiece, the silver casket in the middle, turned the crystal dolphin towards the clock.
They would come; they would stand;
they would talk in the mincing tones which she could imitate, ladies and gentlemen.
Of all, her mistress was loveliest
mistress of silver, of linen, of china, for the sun, the silver, doors off their hinges, Rumpelmayer's men, gave her a sense, as she laid the paper knife on the inlaid table, of something achieved.
She was Lady Angela, attending Princess Mary, when in came Mrs. Dalloway.
And how, she said, turning the crystal dolphin to stand straight
how did you enjoy the play last night?
they had to go before the end! she said.
They had to be back at ten! she said.
So they don't know what happened, she said.
That does seem hard luck, she said for her servants stayed later, if they asked her .
That does seem rather a shame, she said
taking the old bald looking cushion in the middle of the sofa and putting it in Lucy's arms, and giving her a little push, and crying:
Take it away!
Give it to Mrs. Walker with my compliments!
Take it away!
And Lucy stopped at the drawing room door, holding the cushion, and said, very shyly, turning a little pink, Couldn't she help to mend that dress?
But, said Mrs. Dalloway, she had enough on her hands already, quite enough of her own to do without that.
But, thank you, Lucy, oh, thank you, said Mrs. Dalloway, and thank you, thank you, she went on saying sitting down on the sofa with her dress over her knees, her scissors, her silks , thank you, thank you, she went on saying in gratitude to her servants generally for helping her to be like this, to be what she wanted, gentle, generous hearted.
Her servants liked her.
And then this dress of hers where was the tear?
now her needle to be threaded.
This was a favourite dress, one of Sally Parker's, the last almost she ever made, alas, for Sally had now retired, living at Ealing, and if ever I have a moment, thought Clarissa
but never would she have a moment any more
I shall go and see her at Ealing.
For she was a character, thought Clarissa, a real artist.
She thought of little out of the way things
yet her dresses were never queer.
You could wear them at Hatfield
at Buckingham Palace.
She had worn them at Hatfield
Quiet descended on her, calm, content, as her needle, drawing the silk smoothly to its gentle pause, collected the green folds together and attached them, very lightly, to the belt.
So on a summer's day waves collect, overbalance, and fall;
collect and fall
and the whole world seems to be saying that is all more and more ponderously, until even the heart in the body which lies in the sun on the beach says too, That is all.
Fear no more, says the heart.
Fear no more, says the heart, committing its burden to some sea, which sighs collectively for all sorrows, and renews, begins, collects, lets fall.
And the body alone listens to the passing bee
the wave breaking
the dog barking, far away barking and barking.
Heavens, the front door bell! exclaimed Clarissa, staying her needle.
Roused, she listened.
Mrs. Dalloway will see me, said the elderly man in the hall.
putting Lucy aside very benevolently, and running upstairs ever so quickly.
Yes, yes, yes, he muttered as he ran upstairs.
She will see me.
After five years in India, Clarissa will see me.
Who can what can, asked Mrs. Dalloway thinking it was outrageous to be interrupted at eleven o'clock on the morning of the day she was giving a party , hearing a step on the stairs.
She heard a hand upon the door.
She made to hide her dress, like a virgin protecting chastity, respecting privacy.
Now the brass knob slipped.
Now the door opened, and in came
so surprised she was to see him, so glad, so shy, so utterly taken aback to have Peter Walsh come to her unexpectedly in the morning!
She had not read his letter.
And how are you? said Peter Walsh, positively trembling
taking both her hands
kissing both her hands.
She's grown older, he thought, sitting down.
I shan't tell her anything about it, he thought, for she's grown older.
She's looking at me, he thought, a sudden embarrassment coming over him, though he had kissed her hands.
Putting his hand into his pocket, he took out a large pocket knife and half opened the blade.
Exactly the same, thought Clarissa;
the same queer look;
the same check suit;
a little out of the straight his face is, a little thinner, dryer, perhaps, but he looks awfully well, and just the same.
How heavenly it is to see you again! she exclaimed.
He had his knife out.
That's so like him, she thought.
He had only reached town last night, he said
would have to go down into the country at once
and how was everything, how was everybody
Richard?
Elizabeth?
And what's all this? he said, tilting his pen knife towards her green dress.
He's very well dressed, thought Clarissa
yet he always criticises ME.
Here she is mending her dress
mending her dress as usual, he thought
here she's been sitting all the time I've been in India
mending her dress
playing about
going to parties
running to the House and back and all that, he thought, growing more and more irritated, more and more agitated, for there's nothing in the world so bad for some women as marriage, he thought
and politics; and having a Conservative husband, like the admirable Richard.
So it is, so it is, he thought, shutting his knife with a snap.
Richard's very well.
Richard's at a Committee.
And she opened her scissors, and said, did he mind her just finishing what she was doing to her dress, for they had a party that night?
Which I shan't ask you to, she said.
My dear Peter! she said.
But it was delicious to hear her say that
my dear Peter!
Indeed, it was all so delicious the silver, the chairs; all so delicious!
Why wouldn't she ask him to her party? he asked.
Now of course, thought Clarissa
he's enchanting!
perfectly enchanting!
Now I remember how impossible it was ever to make up my mind and why did I make up my mind not to marry him?
she wondered, that awful summer?
But it's so extraordinary that you should have come this morning! she cried
putting her hands, one on top of another, down on her dress.
Do you remember, she said, how the blinds used to flap at Bourton?
They did, he said
and he remembered breakfasting alone, very awkwardly, with her father
who had died
and he had not written to Clarissa.
But he had never got on well with old Parry, that querulous, weak kneed old man, Clarissa's father, Justin Parry.
I often wish I'd got on better with your father, he said.
But he never liked any one who our friends, said Clarissa
and could have bitten her tongue for thus reminding Peter that he had wanted to marry her.
Of course I did, thought Peter
it almost broke my heart too, he thought
and was overcome with his own grief, which rose like a moon looked at from a terrace, ghastly beautiful with light from the sunken day.
I was more unhappy than I've ever been since, he thought.
And as if in truth he were sitting there on the terrace he edged a little towards Clarissa
put his hand out
raised it
let it fall.
There above them it hung, that moon.
She too seemed to be sitting with him on the terrace, in the moonlight.
Herbert has it now, she said.
I never go there now, she said.
Then, just as happens on a terrace in the moonlight, when one person begins to feel ashamed that he is already bored, and yet as the other sits silent, very quiet, sadly looking at the moon, does not like to speak, moves his foot, clears his throat, notices some iron scroll on a table leg, stirs a leaf
but says nothing so Peter Walsh did now.
For why go back like this to the past? he thought.
Why make him think of it again?
Why make him suffer
when she had tortured him so infernally?
Do you remember the lake? she said
in an abrupt voice, under the pressure of an emotion which caught her heart, made the muscles of her throat stiff, and contracted her lips in a spasm as she said lake.
For she was a child, throwing bread to the ducks, between her parents, and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who stood by the lake, holding her life in her arms which, as she neared them, grew larger and larger in her arms, until it became a whole life, a complete life, which she put down by them and said, This is what I have made of it!
This!
And what had she made of it?
What, indeed?
sitting there sewing this morning with Peter.
She looked at Peter Walsh
her look, passing through all that time and that emotion, reached him doubtfully
settled on him tearfully
and rose and fluttered away, as a bird touches a branch and rises and flutters away.
Quite simply she wiped her eyes.
Yes, said Peter.
Yes, yes, yes, he said, as if she drew up to the surface something which positively hurt him as it rose.
Stop! he wanted to cry.
Stop!
For he was not old
his life was not over
not by any means.
He was only just past fifty.
Shall I tell her, he thought, or not?
He would like to make a clean breast of it all.
But she is too cold, he thought
sewing, with her scissors
Daisy would look ordinary beside Clarissa.
And she would think me a failure, which I am in their sense, he thought; in the Dalloways' sense.
Oh yes
he had no doubt about that
he was a failure
compared with all this the inlaid table, the mounted paper knife, the dolphin and the candlesticks, the chair covers and the old valuable
he was a failure!
I detest the smugness of the whole affair, he thought
Richard's doing, not Clarissa's
save that she married him.
Here Lucy came into the room, carrying silver, more silver, but charming, slender, graceful she looked, he thought, as she stooped to put it down.
I he thought; and at once everything seemed to radiate from him; journeys; rides; quarrels; adventures; bridge parties
love affairs; work; work, work!
and he took out his knife quite openly his old horn handled knife which Clarissa could swear he had had these thirty years and clenched his fist upon it.
What an extraordinary habit that was, Clarissa thought;
Always making one feel
empty minded; a mere silly chatterbox, as he used.
But I too, she thought, and, taking up her needle, summoned, like a Queen whose guards have fallen asleep and left her unprotected
she had been quite taken aback by this visit it had upset her so that any one can stroll in and have a look at her where she lies with the brambles curving over her, summoned to her help the things she did
the things she liked; her husband; Elizabeth
her self, in short, which Peter hardly knew now, all to come about her and beat off the enemy.
Well, and what's happened to you? she said.
So before a battle begins, the horses paw the ground
toss their heads
the light shines on their flanks
their necks curve.
So Peter Walsh and Clarissa, sitting side by side on the blue sofa, challenged each other.
His powers chafed and tossed in him.
He assembled from different quarters all sorts of things; praise; his career at Oxford; his marriage, which she knew nothing whatever about; how he had loved; and altogether done his job.
Millions of things! he exclaimed
and, urged by the assembly of powers which were now charging this way and that and giving him the feeling at once frightening and extremely exhilarating of being rushed through the air on the shoulders of people he could no longer see, he raised his hands to his forehead.
Clarissa sat very upright
drew in her breath.
I am in love, he said, not to her however, but to some one raised up in the dark so that you could not touch her but must lay your garland down on the grass in the dark.
In love, he repeated
now speaking rather dryly to Clarissa; in love with a girl in India.
In love! she said.
That he at his age should be sucked under in his little bow tie by that monster!
And there's no flesh on his neck
his hands are red
and he's six months older than I am!
her eye flashed back to her; but in her heart she felt, all the same, he is in love.
He has that, she felt; he is in love.
But the indomitable egotism which for ever rides down the hosts opposed to it, the river which says on, on, on
even though, it admits, there may be no goal for us whatever, still on, on
this indomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour
made her look very young; very pink; very bright eyed as she sat with her dress upon her knee, and her needle held to the end of green silk, trembling a little.
He was in love!
Not with her.
With some younger woman, of course.
And who is she? she asked.
Now this statue must be brought from its height and set down between them.
A married woman, unfortunately, he said; the wife of a Major in the Indian Army.
And with a curious ironical sweetness he smiled as he placed her in this ridiculous way before Clarissa.
All the same, he is in love, thought Clarissa.
She has, he continued, very reasonably, two small children
a boy and a girl
and I have come over to see my lawyers about the divorce.
There they are! he thought.
Do what you like with them, Clarissa!
There they are!
And second by second it seemed to him that the wife of the Major in the Indian Army his Daisy and her two small children became more and more lovely as Clarissa looked at them
as if he had set light to a grey pellet on a plate and there had risen up a lovely tree in the brisk sea salted air of their intimacy
for in some ways no one understood him, felt with him, as Clarissa did their exquisite intimacy.
She flattered him; she fooled him, thought Clarissa
shaping the woman, the wife of the Major in the Indian Army, with three strokes of a knife.
What a waste!
What a folly!
All his life long Peter had been fooled like that
first getting sent down from Oxford; next marrying the girl on the boat going out to India
now the wife of a Major in the Indian Army thank Heaven she had refused to marry him!
Still, he was in love
her old friend, her dear Peter, he was in love.
But what are you going to do? she asked him.
Hooper and Grateley of Lincoln's Inn, they were going to do it, he said.
And he actually pared his nails with his pocket knife.
For Heaven's sake, leave your knife alone! she cried to herself in irrepressible irritation
it was his silly unconventionality, his weakness
his lack of the ghost of a notion what any one else was feeling that annoyed her, had always annoyed her
and now at his age, how silly!
I know all that, Peter thought
I know what I'm up against, he thought, running his finger along the blade of his knife, Clarissa and Dalloway and all the rest of them
but I'll show Clarissa and then to his utter surprise, suddenly thrown by those uncontrollable forces thrown through the air, he burst into tears
he wept
he wept without the least shame, sitting on the sofa, the tears running down his cheeks.
And Clarissa had leant forward, taken his hand, drawn him to her, kissed him actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver flashing plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast, which, subsiding, left her holding his hand, patting his knee and, feeling as she sat back extraordinarily at her ease with him and light hearted, all in a clap it came over her, If I had married him, this gaiety would have been mine all day!
It was all over for her.
The sheet was stretched and the bed narrow.
She had gone up into the tower alone and left them blackberrying in the sun.
The door had shut, and there among the dust of fallen plaster and the litter of birds' nests how distant the view had looked, and the sounds came thin and chill once on Leith Hill, she remembered , and Richard, Richard!
she cried, as a sleeper in the night starts and stretches a hand in the dark for help.
Lunching with Lady Bruton, it came back to her.
He has left me; I am alone for ever, she thought, folding her hands upon her knee.
Peter Walsh had got up and crossed to the window and stood with his back to her, flicking a bandanna handkerchief from side to side.
Masterly and dry and desolate he looked, his thin shoulder blades lifting his coat slightly; blowing his nose violently.
Take me with you, Clarissa thought impulsively, as if he were starting directly upon some great voyage
and then, next moment, it was as if the five acts of a play that had been very exciting and moving were now over and she had lived a lifetime in them and had run away, had lived with Peter, and it was now over.
Now it was time to move, and, as a woman gathers her things together, her cloak, her gloves, her opera glasses, and gets up to go out of the theatre into the street, she rose from the sofa and went to Peter.
And it was awfully strange, he thought, how she still had the power, as she came tinkling, rustling, still had the power as she came across the room, to make the moon, which he detested, rise at Bourton on the terrace in the summer sky.
Tell me, he said, seizing her by the shoulders.
Are you happy, Clarissa?
Does Richard
Here is my Elizabeth, said Clarissa, emotionally, histrionically, perhaps.
How d'y do? said Elizabeth coming forward.
The sound of Big Ben striking the half hour struck out between them with extraordinary vigour
as if a young man, strong, indifferent, inconsiderate, were swinging dumb bells this way and that.
Hullo, Elizabeth! cried Peter
stuffing his handkerchief into his pocket, going quickly to her, saying Good bye, Clarissa
without looking at her, leaving the room quickly, and running downstairs and opening the hall door.
Peter! cried Clarissa, following him out on to the landing.
Peter!
My party to night!
Remember my party to night!
she cried, having to raise her voice against the roar of the open air, and, overwhelmed by the traffic and the sound of all the clocks striking, her voice crying Remember my party to night!
sounded frail and thin and very far away as Peter Walsh shut the door.
Remember my party, remember my party, said Peter Walsh as he stepped down the street, speaking to himself rhythmically, in time with the flow of the sound, the direct downright sound of Big Ben striking the half hour.
The leaden circles dissolved in the air.
Oh these parties, he thought; Clarissa's parties.
Why does she give these parties, he thought.
And there he was, this fortunate man, himself, reflected in the plate glass window of a motor car manufacturer in Victoria Street.
All India lay behind him; plains, mountains; epidemics of cholera;
a district twice as big as Ireland
decisions he had come to alone he, Peter Walsh;
who was now really for the first time in his life, in love.
Clarissa had grown hard, he thought
and a trifle sentimental into the bargain, he suspected, looking at the great motor cars capable of doing how many miles on how many gallons?
For he had a turn for mechanics
had invented a plough in his district, had ordered wheel barrows from England, but the coolies wouldn't use them, all of which Clarissa knew nothing whatever about.
The way she said Here is my Elizabeth!
that annoyed him.
Why not Here's Elizabeth simply?
It was insincere.
And Elizabeth didn't like it either.
Still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him; the half hour
still early
only half past eleven still.
For he understood young people
he liked them.
There was always something cold in Clarissa, he thought.
She had always, even as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes conventionality, and then it's all up, it's all up, he thought, looking rather drearily into the glassy depths, and wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her
overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool
he wept
been emotional
told her everything, as usual, as usual.
As a cloud crosses the sun, silence falls on London; and falls on the mind.
Effort ceases.
Time flaps on the mast.
There we stop; there we stand.
Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.
Where there is nothing, Peter Walsh said to himself
feeling hollowed out, utterly empty within.
Clarissa refused me, he thought.
He stood there thinking, Clarissa refused me.
Ah, said St. Margaret's, like a hostess who comes into her drawing room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already.
I am not late.
No, it is precisely half past eleven, she says.
Yet, though she is perfectly right
her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality.
Some grief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present.
It is half past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret's glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest like Clarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white.
It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with the moment.
But what room?
What moment?
And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking?
Then, as the sound of St. Margaret's languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the sound expressed languor and suffering.
It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing room.
No! he cried.
She is not dead!
I am not old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending, his future.
He was not old, or set, or dried in the least.
As for caring what they said of him the Dalloways, the Whitbreads, and their set, he cared not a straw not a straw though it was true he would have, some time or other, to see whether Richard couldn't help him to some job .
Striding, staring, he glared at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge.
He had been sent down from Oxford
It's true.
He had been a Socialist
in some sense a failure
Still the future of civilisation lies, he thought, in the hands of young men like that
of young men such as he was, thirty years ago
with their love of abstract principles
getting books sent out to them all the way from London to a peak in the Himalayas
reading science
reading philosophy.
The future lies in the hands of young men like that, he thought.
A patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind, and with it a rustling, regular thudding sound, which as it overtook him drummed his thoughts, strict in step, up Whitehall, without his doing.
Boys in uniform, carrying guns, marched with their eyes ahead of them, marched, their arms stiff, and on their faces an expression like the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue praising duty, gratitude, fidelity, love of England.
It is, thought Peter Walsh, beginning to keep step with them, a very fine training.
But they did not look robust.
They were weedy for the most part, boys of sixteen, who might, to morrow, stand behind bowls of rice, cakes of soap on counters.
Now they wore on them unmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity of the wreath which they had fetched from Finsbury Pavement to the empty tomb.
They had taken their vow.
The traffic respected it; vans were stopped.
I can't keep up with them, Peter Walsh thought, as they marched up Whitehall, and sure enough, on they marched, past him, past every one, in their steady way, as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly, and life, with its varieties, its irreticences, had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline.
One had to respect it
one might laugh
but one had to respect it, he thought.
There they go, thought Peter Walsh, pausing at the edge of the pavement
and all the exalted statues, Nelson, Gordon, Havelock, the black, the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them, as if they too had made the same renunciation Peter Walsh felt he too had made it, the great renunciation
trampled under the same temptations, and achieved at length a marble stare.
But the stare Peter Walsh did not want for himself in the least; though he could respect it in others.
He could respect it in boys.
They don't know the troubles of the flesh yet, he thought, as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the Strand all that I've been through, he thought, crossing the road, and standing under Gordon's statue, Gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed poor Gordon, he thought.
And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except Clarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an island to him, the strangeness of standing alone, alive, unknown, at half past eleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him.
What is it?
Where am I?
And why, after all, does one do it?
the divorce seeming all moonshine.
And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him
understanding;
a vast philanthropy;
and finally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight
as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues, down which if he chose he might wander.
He had not felt so young for years.
He had escaped!
was utterly free as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind, like an unguarded flame, bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding.
I haven't felt so young for years! thought Peter
escaping only of course for an hour or so from being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs out of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong window.
But she's extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking across Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a young woman who, as she passed Gordon's statue, seemed, Peter Walsh thought susceptible as he was , to shed veil after veil, until she became the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately; merry, but discreet; black, but enchanting.
Straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket knife he started after her to follow this woman, this excitement, which seemed even with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected them, which singled him out
as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name, not Peter, but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts.
You, she said, only you, saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders.
Then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past Dent's shop in Cockspur Street blew out with an enveloping kindness, a mournful tenderness, as of arms that would open and take the tired 
But she's not married
she's young
quite young, thought Peter
the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across Trafalgar Square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red.
But she waited at the kerbstone.
There was a dignity about her.
She was not worldly, like Clarissa; not rich, like Clarissa.
Was she, he wondered as she moved, respectable?
Witty, with a lizard's flickering tongue, he thought for one must invent, must allow oneself a little diversion , a cool waiting wit, a darting wit
not noisy.
She moved
she crossed
he followed her.
To embarrass her was the last thing he wished.
Still if she stopped he would say Come and have an ice, he would say, and she would answer, perfectly simply, Oh yes.
But other people got between them in the street, obstructing him, blotting her out.
He pursued
she changed.
There was colour in her cheeks; mockery in her eyes
he was an adventurer, reckless, he thought, swift, daring, indeed landed as he was last night from India
a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned proprieties, yellow dressing gowns, pipes, fishing rods, in the shop windows;
and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats.
He was a buccaneer.
On and on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent Street, ahead of him, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement, as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness.
Laughing and delightful, she had crossed Oxford Street and Great Portland Street and turned down one of the little streets, and now, and now, the great moment was approaching, for now she slackened, opened her bag, and with one look in his direction, but not at him, one look that bade farewell, summed up the whole situation and dismissed it triumphantly, for ever, had fitted her key, opened the door, and gone!
Clarissa's voice saying, Remember my party, Remember my party, sang in his ears.
The house was one of those flat red houses with hanging flower baskets of vague impropriety.
It was over.
Well, I've had my fun; I've had it, he thought, looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums.
And it was smashed to atoms his fun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented, this escapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better part of life, he thought making oneself up
making her up
creating an exquisite amusement, and something more.
But odd it was, and quite true
all this one could never share
it smashed to atoms.
went up the street, thinking to find somewhere to sit, till it was time for Lincoln's Inn for Messrs. Hooper and Grateley.
Where should he go?
No matter.
Up the street, then, towards Regent's Park.
His boots on the pavement struck out no matter; for it was early, still very early.
It was a splendid morning too.
Like the pulse of a perfect heart, life struck straight through the streets.
There was no fumbling no hesitation.
Sweeping and swerving, accurately, punctually, noiselessly, there, precisely at the right instant, the motor car stopped at the door.
The girl, silk stockinged, feathered, evanescent, but not to him particularly attractive for he had had his fling , alighted.
Admirable butlers, tawny chow dogs, halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing
Peter saw through the opened door and approved of.
A splendid achievement in its own way, after all, London; the season; civilisation.
Coming as he did from a respectable Anglo Indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent it's strange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking India, and empire, and army as he did , there were moments when civilisation, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal possession;
moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls in their security.
Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought.
And the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly admirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one's life, companions in the art of living, who would see one through.
What with one thing and another, the show was really very tolerable; and he would sit down in the shade and smoke.
There was Regent's Park.
As a child he had walked in Regent's Park odd, he thought, how the thought of childhood keeps coming back to me the result of seeing Clarissa, perhaps;
for women live much more in the past than we do, he thought.
They attach themselves to places; and their fathers a woman's always proud of her father.
Bourton was a nice place, a very nice place, but I could never get on with the old man, he thought.
There was quite a scene one night an argument about something or other, what, he could not remember.
Politics presumably.
Yes, he remembered Regent's Park; the long straight walk; the little house where one bought air balls to the left; an absurd statue with an inscription somewhere or other.
He looked for an empty seat.
He did not want to be bothered feeling a little drowsy as he did by people asking him the time.
An elderly grey nurse, with a baby asleep in its perambulator that was the best he could do for himself; sit down at the far end of the seat by that nurse.
She's a queer looking girl, he thought, suddenly remembering Elizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother.
Grown big; quite grown up, not exactly pretty; handsome rather; and she can't be more than eighteen.
Probably she doesn't get on with Clarissa.
There's my Elizabeth that sort of thing why not Here's Elizabeth simply?
trying to make out, like most mothers, that things are what they're not.
She trusts to her charm too much, he thought.
She overdoes it.
The rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat
he puffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a moment
blue, circular I shall try and get a word alone with Elizabeth to night, he thought then began to wobble into hour glass shapes and taper away
odd shapes they take, he thought.
Suddenly he closed his eyes, raised his hand with an effort, and threw away the heavy end of his cigar.
A great brush swept smooth across his mind, sweeping across it moving branches, children's voices, the shuffle of feet, and people passing, and humming traffic, rising and falling traffic.
Down, down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep, sank, and was muffled over.
The grey nurse resumed her knitting as Peter Walsh, on the hot seat beside her, began snoring.
In her grey dress, moving her hands indefatigably yet quietly, she seemed like the champion of the rights of sleepers, like one of those spectral presences which rise in twilight in woods made of sky and branches.
The solitary traveller, haunter of lanes, disturber of ferns, and devastator of great hemlock plants, looking up, suddenly sees the giant figure at the end of the ride.
By conviction an atheist perhaps, he is taken by surprise with moments of extraordinary exaltation.
Nothing exists outside us except a state of mind, he thinks
a desire for solace, for relief, for something outside these miserable pigmies, these feeble, these ugly, these craven men and women.
But if he can conceive of her, then in some sort she exists, he thinks, and advancing down the path with his eyes upon sky and branches he rapidly endows them with womanhood
sees with amazement how grave they become
how majestically, as the breeze stirs them, they dispense with a dark flutter of the leaves charity, comprehension, absolution
and then, flinging themselves suddenly aloft, confound the piety of their aspect with a wild carouse.
Such are the visions which proffer great cornucopias full of fruit to the solitary traveller, or murmur in his ear like sirens lolloping away on the green sea waves, or are dashed in his face like bunches of roses, or rise to the surface like pale faces which fishermen flounder through floods to embrace.
Such are the visions which ceaselessly float up, pace beside, put their faces in front of, the actual thing
often overpowering the solitary traveller and taking away from him the sense of the earth, the wish to return, and giving him for substitute a general peace, as if so he thinks as he advances down the forest ride all this fever of living were simplicity itself
and myriads of things merged in one thing
and this figure, made of sky and branches as it is, had risen from the troubled sea he is elderly, past fifty now as a shape might be sucked up out of the waves to shower down from her magnificent hands compassion, comprehension, absolution.
So, he thinks, may I never go back to the lamplight;
to the sitting room
never finish my book
never knock out my pipe; never ring for Mrs. Turner to clear away
rather let me walk straight on to this great figure, who will, with a toss of her head, mount me on her streamers and let me blow to nothingness with the rest.
Such are the visions.
The solitary traveller is soon beyond the wood; and there, coming to the door with shaded eyes, possibly to look for his return, with hands raised, with white apron blowing, is an elderly woman who seems so powerful is this infirmity to seek, over a desert, a lost son
to search for a rider destroyed; to be the figure of the mother whose sons have been killed in the battles of the world.
So, as the solitary traveller advances down the village street where the women stand knitting and the men dig in the garden, the evening seems ominous; the figures still
as if some august fate, known to them, awaited without fear, were about to sweep them into complete annihilation.
Indoors among ordinary things, the cupboard, the table, the window sill with its geraniums, suddenly the outline of the landlady, bending to remove the cloth, becomes soft with light, an adorable emblem which only the recollection of cold human contacts forbids us to embrace.
She takes the marmalade
she shuts it in the cupboard.
There is nothing more to night, sir?
But to whom does the solitary traveller make reply?
So the elderly nurse knitted over the sleeping baby in Regent's Park.
So Peter Walsh snored.
He woke with extreme suddenness, saying to himself, The death of the soul.
Lord, Lord! he said to himself out loud, stretching and opening his eyes.
The death of the soul.
The words attached themselves to some scene, to some room, to some past he had been dreaming of.
It became clearer
the scene, the room, the past he had been dreaming of.
It was at Bourton that summer, early in the nineties, when he was so passionately in love with Clarissa.
There were a great many people there, laughing and talking, sitting round a table after tea and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke.
They were talking about a man who had married his housemaid, one of the neighbouring squires, he had forgotten his name.
He had married his housemaid, and she had been brought to Bourton to call
an awful visit it had been.
She was absurdly over dressed, like a cockatoo, Clarissa had said, imitating her, and she never stopped talking.
On and on she went, on and on.
Clarissa imitated her.
Then somebody said Sally Seton it was
did it make any real difference to one's feelings to know that before they'd married she had had a baby?
In those days, in mixed company, it was a bold thing to say.
He could see Clarissa now, turning bright pink
somehow contracting
and saying, Oh
I shall never be able to speak to her again!
Whereupon the whole party sitting round the tea table seemed to wobble.
It was very uncomfortable.
He hadn't blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing, but it was her manner that annoyed him; timid; hard; something arrogant; unimaginative; prudish.
He had said that instinctively, ticketing the moment as he used to do the death of her soul.
Every one wobbled; every one seemed to bow, as she spoke, and then to stand up different.
He could see Sally Seton, like a child who has been in mischief, leaning forward, rather flushed, wanting to talk, but afraid, and Clarissa did frighten people.
She was Clarissa's greatest friend, always about the place, totally unlike her, an attractive creature, handsome, dark, with the reputation in those days of great daring and he used to give her cigars, which she smoked in her bedroom.
She had either been engaged to somebody or quarrelled with her family and old Parry disliked them both equally, which was a great bond.
Then Clarissa, still with an air of being offended with them all, got up, made some excuse, and went off, alone.
As she opened the door, in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep.
She flung herself upon him, went into raptures.
It was as if she said to Peter it was all aimed at him, he knew I know you thought me absurd about that woman just now
but see how extraordinarily sympathetic I am
see how I love my Rob!
They had always this queer power of communicating without words.
She knew directly he criticised her.
Then she would do something quite obvious to defend herself, like this fuss with the dog
but it never took him in
he always saw through Clarissa.
Not that he said anything, of course
just sat looking glum.
It was the way their quarrels often began.
She shut the door.
At once he became extremely depressed.
It all seemed useless going on being in love
going on quarrelling
going on making it up, and he wandered off alone, among outhouses, stables, looking at the horses.
The place was quite a humble one
the Parrys were never very well off
but there were always grooms and stable boys about Clarissa loved riding and an old coachman what was his name?
an old nurse, old Moody, old Goody, some such name they called her, whom one was taken to visit in a little room with lots of photographs, lots of bird cages.
It was an awful evening!
He grew more and more gloomy, not about that only; about everything.
And he couldn't see her
couldn't explain to her
couldn't have it out.
There were always people about she'd go on as if nothing had happened.
That was the devilish part of her this coldness, this woodenness, something very profound in her, which he had felt again this morning talking to her; an impenetrability.
Yet Heaven knows he loved her.
She had some queer power of fiddling on one's nerves, turning one's nerves to fiddle strings, yes.
He had gone in to dinner rather late, from some idiotic idea of making himself felt, and had sat down by old Miss Parry Aunt Helena Mr. Parry's sister, who was supposed to preside.
There she sat in her white Cashmere shawl, with her head against the window a formidable old lady, but kind to him, for he had found her some rare flower, and she was a great botanist, marching off in thick boots with a black collecting box slung between her shoulders.
He sat down beside her, and couldn't speak.
Everything seemed to race past him; he just sat there, eating.
And then half way through dinner he made himself look across at Clarissa for the first time.
She was talking to a young man on her right.
He had a sudden revelation.
She will marry that man, he said to himself.
He didn't even know his name.
For of course it was that afternoon, that very afternoon, that Dalloway had come over
and Clarissa called him Wickham
that was the beginning of it all.
Somebody had brought him over
and Clarissa got his name wrong.
She introduced him to everybody as Wickham.
At last he said My name is Dalloway!
that was his first view of Richard a fair young man, rather awkward, sitting on a deck chair, and blurting out My name is Dalloway!
Sally got hold of it
always after that she called him My name is Dalloway!
He was a prey to revelations at that time.
This one that she would marry Dalloway was blinding overwhelming at the moment.
There was a sort of how could he put it?
a sort of ease in her manner to him
something maternal
something gentle.
They were talking about politics.
All through dinner he tried to hear what they were saying.
Afterwards he could remember standing by old Miss Parry's chair in the drawing room.
Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a real hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one spoke as if they had never met before, which enraged him.
Yet even then he admired her for it.
He admired her courage
her social instinct
he admired her power of carrying things through.
The perfect hostess, he said to her, whereupon she winced all over.
But he meant her to feel it.
He would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with Dalloway.
So she left him.
And he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him laughing and talking behind his back.
There he stood by Miss Parry's chair as though he had been cut out of wood, he talking about wild flowers.
Never, never had he suffered so infernally!
He must have forgotten even to pretend to listen
at last he woke up
he saw Miss Parry looking rather disturbed, rather indignant, with her prominent eyes fixed.
He almost cried out that he couldn't attend because he was in Hell!
People began going out of the room.
He heard them talking about fetching cloaks; about its being cold on the water, and so on.
They were going boating on the lake by moonlight one of Sally's mad ideas.
He could hear her describing the moon.
And they all went out.
He was left quite alone.
Don't you want to go with them? said Aunt Helena
old Miss Parry!
she had guessed.
And he turned round and there was Clarissa again.
She had come back to fetch him.
He was overcome by her generosity her goodness.
Come along, she said.
They're waiting.
He had never felt so happy in the whole of his life!
Without a word they made it up.
They walked down to the lake.
He had twenty minutes of perfect happiness.
Her voice, her laugh, her dress something floating, white, crimson , her spirit, her adventurousness
she made them all disembark and explore the island
she startled a hen
she laughed
she sang.
And all the time, he knew perfectly well, Dalloway was falling in love with her
she was falling in love with Dalloway
but it didn't seem to matter.
Nothing mattered.
They sat on the ground and talked
he and Clarissa.
They went in and out of each other's minds without any effort.
And then in a second it was over.
He said to himself as they were getting into the boat, She will marry that man, dully, without any resentment
but it was an obvious thing.
Dalloway would marry Clarissa.
Dalloway rowed them in.
But somehow as they watched him start, jumping on to his bicycle to ride twenty miles through the woods, wobbling off down the drive, waving his hand and disappearing, he obviously did feel, instinctively, tremendously, strongly, all that; the night; the romance; Clarissa.
This boy's elegy is played among the traffic, thought Septimus.
Now he withdraws up into the snows, and roses hang about him the thick red roses which grow on my bedroom wall, he reminded himself.
The music stopped.
He has his penny, he reasoned it out, and has gone on to the next public house.
But he himself remained high on his rock, like a drowned sailor on a rock.
I leant over the edge of the boat and fell down, he thought.
I went under the sea.
I have been dead
yet am now alive, but let me rest still
he begged
he was talking to himself again it was awful, awful!
and as, before waking, the voices of birds and the sound of wheels chime and chatter in a queer harmony, grow louder and louder and the sleeper feels himself drawing to the shores of life, so he felt himself drawing towards life, the sun growing hotter, cries sounding louder, something tremendous about to happen.
He had only to open his eyes
but a weight was on them; a fear.
He strained
he pushed
he looked
he saw Regent's Park before him.
Long streamers of sunlight fawned at his feet.
The trees waved, brandished.
We welcome, the world seemed to say
we accept
we create.
Beauty, the world seemed to say.
And as if to prove it scientifically wherever he looked at the houses, at the railings, at the antelopes stretching over the palings, beauty sprang instantly.
To watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an exquisite joy.
Up in the sky swallows swooping, swerving, flinging themselves in and out, round and round, yet always with perfect control as if elastics held them;
and the flies rising and falling;
and the sun spotting now this leaf, now that, in mockery, dazzling it with soft gold in pure good temper;
and now and again some chime it might be a motor horn tinkling divinely on the grass stalks all of this, calm and reasonable as it was, made out of ordinary things as it was, was the truth now; beauty, that was the truth now.
Beauty was everywhere.
It is time, said Rezia.
The word time split its husk;
poured its riches over him;
and from his lips fell like shells, like shavings from a plane, without his making them, hard, white, imperishable words, and flew to attach themselves to their places in an ode to Time;
an immortal ode to Time.
He sang.
Evans answered from behind the tree.
The dead were in Thessaly, Evans sang, among the orchids.
There they waited till the War was over, and now the dead, now Evans himself 
For God's sake don't come! Septimus cried out.
For he could not look upon the dead.
But the branches parted.
A man in grey was actually walking towards them.
It was Evans!
But no mud was on him
no wounds
he was not changed.
I must tell the whole world, Septimus cried, raising his hand
as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer
raising his hand like some colossal figure who has lamented the fate of man for ages in the desert alone with his hands pressed to his forehead, furrows of despair on his cheeks, and now sees light on the desert's edge which broadens and strikes the iron black figure and Septimus half rose from his chair , and with legions of men prostrate behind him he, the giant mourner, receives for one moment on his face the whole 
But I am so unhappy, Septimus, said Rezia trying to make him sit down.
The millions lamented; for ages they had sorrowed.
He would turn round, he would tell them in a few moments, only a few moments more, of this relief, of this joy, of this astonishing revelation 
The time, Septimus, Rezia repeated.
What is the time?
He was talking, he was starting, this man must notice him.
He was looking at them.
I will tell you the time, said Septimus, very slowly, very drowsily, smiling mysteriously.
As he sat smiling at the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck the quarter to twelve.
And that is being young, Peter Walsh thought as he passed them.
To be having an awful scene the poor girl looked absolutely desperate in the middle of the morning.
But what was it about, he wondered
what had the young man in the overcoat been saying to her to make her look like that; what awful fix had they got themselves into, both to look so desperate as that on a fine summer morning?
The amusing thing about coming back to England, after five years, was the way it made, anyhow the first days, things stand out as if one had never seen them before
lovers squabbling under a tree
the domestic family life of the parks.
Never had he seen London look so enchanting the softness of the distances; the richness; the greenness; the civilisation, after India, he thought, strolling across the grass.
This susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt.
Still at his age he had, like a boy or a girl even, these alternations of mood; good days, bad days, for no reason whatever, happiness from a pretty face, downright misery at the sight of a frump.
After India of course one fell in love with every woman one met.
There was a freshness about them
even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely
and to his eye the fashions had never been so becoming
the long black cloaks
the slimness
the elegance
and then the delicious and apparently universal habit of paint.
Every woman, even the most respectable, had roses blooming under glass
lips cut with a knife
curls of Indian ink
there was design, art
a change of some sort had undoubtedly taken place.
What did the young people think about? Peter Walsh asked himself.
Those five years 1918 to 1923 had been, he suspected, somehow very important.
People looked different.
Newspapers seemed different.
Now for instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable weeklies about water closets.
That you couldn't have done ten years ago written quite openly about water closets in a respectable weekly.
And then this taking out a stick of rouge, or a powder puff and making up in public.
On board ship coming home there were lots of young men and girls Betty and Bertie he remembered in particular carrying on quite openly
the old mother sitting and watching them with her knitting, cool as a cucumber.
The girl would stand still and powder her nose in front of every one.
And they weren't engaged
just having a good time
no feelings hurt on either side.
As hard as nails she was Betty What'shername ;
but a thorough good sort.
She would make a very good wife at thirty she would marry when it suited her to marry
marry some rich man and live in a large house near Manchester.
Who was it now who had done that? Peter Walsh asked himself, turning into the Broad Walk
married a rich man and lived in a large house near Manchester?
Somebody who had written him a long, gushing letter quite lately about blue hydrangeas.
It was seeing blue hydrangeas that made her think of him and the old days
Sally Seton, of course!
It was Sally Seton the last person in the world one would have expected to marry a rich man and live in a large house near Manchester, the wild, the daring, the romantic Sally!
But of all that ancient lot, Clarissa's friends Whitbreads, Kinderleys, Cunninghams, Kinloch Jones's Sally was probably the best.
She tried to get hold of things by the right end anyhow.
She saw through Hugh Whitbread anyhow the admirable Hugh when Clarissa and the rest were at his feet.
The Whitbreads? he could hear her saying.
Who are the Whitbreads?
Coal merchants.
Respectable tradespeople.
Hugh she detested for some reason.
He thought of nothing but his own appearance, she said.
He would be certain to marry one of the Royal Princesses.
And of course Hugh had the most extraordinary, the most natural, the most sublime respect for the British aristocracy of any human being he had ever come across.
Even Clarissa had to own that.
Oh, but he was such a dear, so unselfish, gave up shooting to please his old mother remembered his aunts' birthdays, and so on.
Sally, to do her justice, saw through all that.
One of the things he remembered best was an argument one Sunday morning at Bourton about women's rights that antediluvian topic , when Sally suddenly lost her temper, flared up, and told Hugh that he represented all that was most detestable in British middle class life.
She told him that she considered him responsible for the state of those poor girls in Piccadilly Hugh, the perfect gentleman, poor Hugh!
never did a man look more horrified!
She did it on purpose she said afterwards for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and compare notes .
He's read nothing, thought nothing, felt nothing, he could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so much farther than she knew.
The stable boys had more life in them than Hugh, she said.
He was a perfect specimen of the public school type, she said.
No country but England could have produced him.
She was really spiteful, for some reason
had some grudge against him.
Something had happened he forgot what in the smoking room.
He had insulted her kissed her?
Incredible!
Nobody believed a word against Hugh of course.
Who could?
Kissing Sally in the smoking room!
If it had been some Honourable Edith or Lady Violet, perhaps; but not that ragamuffin Sally without a penny to her name, and a father or a mother gambling at Monte Carlo.
For of all the people he had ever met Hugh was the greatest snob the most obsequious no, he didn't cringe exactly.
He was too much of a prig for that.
A first rate valet was the obvious comparison
somebody who walked behind carrying suit cases
could be trusted to send telegrams
indispensable to hostesses.
And he'd found his job
married his Honourable Evelyn
got some little post at Court, looked after the King's cellars, polished the Imperial shoe buckles, went about in knee breeches and lace ruffles.
How remorseless life is!
A little job at Court!
He had married this lady, the Honourable Evelyn, and they lived hereabouts, so he thought looking at the pompous houses overlooking the Park , for he had lunched there once in a house which had, like all Hugh's possessions, something that no other house could possibly have
linen cupboards it might have been.
You had to go and look at them you had to spend a great deal of time always admiring whatever it was linen cupboards, pillow cases, old oak furniture, pictures, which Hugh had picked up for an old song.
But Mrs. Hugh sometimes gave the show away.
She was one of those obscure mouse like little women who admire big men.
She was almost negligible.
Then suddenly she would say something quite unexpected something sharp.
She had the relics of the grand manner perhaps.
The steam coal was a little too strong for her
it made the atmosphere thick.
And so there they lived, with their linen cupboards and their old masters and their pillow cases fringed with real lace at the rate of five or ten thousand a year presumably, while he, who was two years older than Hugh, cadged for a job.
At fifty three he had to come and ask them to put him into some secretary's office, to find him some usher's job teaching little boys Latin, at the beck and call of some mandarin in an office, something that brought in five hundred a year
for if he married Daisy, even with his pension, they could never do on less.
Whitbread could do it presumably; or Dalloway.
He didn't mind what he asked Dalloway.
He was a thorough good sort
a bit limited
a bit thick in the head
yes; but a thorough good sort.
Whatever he took up he did in the same matter of fact sensible way;
without a touch of imagination, without a spark of brilliancy, but with the inexplicable niceness of his type.
He ought to have been a country gentleman he was wasted on politics.
He was at his best out of doors, with horses and dogs how good he was, for instance, when that great shaggy dog of Clarissa's got caught in a trap and had its paw half torn off, and Clarissa turned faint and Dalloway did the whole thing; bandaged, made splints
told Clarissa not to be a fool.
That was what she liked him for perhaps
that was what she needed.
Now, my dear, don't be a fool.
Hold this fetch that, all the time talking to the dog as if it were a human being.
But how could she swallow all that stuff about poetry?
How could she let him hold forth about Shakespeare?
Seriously and solemnly Richard Dalloway got on his hind legs and said that no decent man ought to read Shakespeare's sonnets because it was like listening at keyholes besides the relationship was not one that he approved .
No decent man ought to let his wife visit a deceased wife's sister.
Incredible!
The only thing to do was to pelt him with sugared almonds it was at dinner.
But Clarissa sucked it all in thought it so honest of him; so independent of him
Heaven knows if she didn't think him the most original mind she'd ever met!
That was one of the bonds between Sally and himself.
There was a garden where they used to walk, a walled in place, with rose bushes and giant cauliflowers he could remember Sally tearing off a rose, stopping to exclaim at the beauty of the cabbage leaves in the moonlight it was extraordinary how vividly it all came back to him, things he hadn't thought of for years, while she implored him, half laughing of course, to carry off Clarissa, to save her from the Hughs and the Dalloways and all the other perfect gentlemen who would stifle her soul she wrote reams of poetry in those days , make a mere hostess of her, encourage her worldliness.
But one must do Clarissa justice.
She wasn't going to marry Hugh anyhow.
She had a perfectly clear notion of what she wanted.
Her emotions were all on the surface.
Beneath, she was very shrewd a far better judge of character than Sally, for instance, and with it all, purely feminine
with that extraordinary gift, that woman's gift, of making a world of her own wherever she happened to be.
She came into a room;
she stood, as he had often seen her, in a doorway with lots of people round her.
But it was Clarissa one remembered.
Not that she was striking
not beautiful at all;
there was nothing picturesque about her;
she never said anything specially clever;
there she was, however;
there she was.
No, no, no!
He was not in love with her any more!
He only felt, after seeing her that morning, among her scissors and silks, making ready for the party, unable to get away from the thought of her
she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage;
which was not being in love, of course;
it was thinking of her, criticising her, starting again, after thirty years, trying to explain her.
The obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly;
cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world which was true in a sense; she had admitted it to him.
You could always get her to own up if you took the trouble
she was honest.
What she would say was that she hated frumps, fogies, failures, like himself presumably
thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets
must do something, be something
and these great swells, these Duchesses, these hoary old Countesses one met in her drawing room, unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw, stood for something real to her.
Lady Bexborough, she said once, held herself upright
so did Clarissa herself
she never lounged in any sense of the word
she was straight as a dart, a little rigid in fact.
She said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected.
In all this there was a great deal of Dalloway, of course; a great deal of the public spirited, British Empire, tariff reform, governing class spirit, which had grown on her, as it tends to do.
With twice his wits, she had to see things through his eyes one of the tragedies of married life.
With a mind of her own, she must always be quoting Richard as if one couldn't know to a tittle what Richard thought by reading the Morning Post of a morning!
These parties for example were all for him, or for her idea of him to do Richard justice he would have been happier farming in Norfolk .
She made her drawing room a sort of meeting place; she had a genius for it.
Over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth, twist him, turn him, wake him up; set him going.
Infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course.
But odd unexpected people turned up
an artist sometimes
sometimes a writer;
queer fish in that atmosphere.
And behind it all was that network of visiting, leaving cards, being kind to people;
running about with bunches of flowers, little presents;
So and so was going to France must have an air cushion;
a real drain on her strength;
all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up;
but she did it genuinely, from a natural instinct.
Oddly enough, she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had ever met, and possibly this was a theory he used to make up to account for her, so transparent in some ways, so inscrutable in others , possibly she said to herself, As we are a doomed race, chained to a sinking ship her favourite reading as a girl was Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical metaphors , as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part;
mitigate the sufferings of our fellow prisoners Huxley again ;
decorate the dungeon with flowers and air cushions;
be as decent as we possibly can.
Those ruffians, the Gods, shan't have it all their own way her notion being that the Gods, who never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives were seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady.
That phase came directly after Sylvia's death that horrible affair.
To see your own sister killed by a falling tree all Justin Parry's fault all his carelessness before your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one bitter.
Later she wasn't so positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for the sake of goodness.
And of course she enjoyed life immensely.
It was her nature to enjoy though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a mere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years, could make of Clarissa .
Anyhow there was no bitterness in her; none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women.
She enjoyed practically everything.
If you walked with her in Hyde Park now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator, now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment.
Very likely, she would have talked to those lovers, if she had thought them unhappy.
She had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite, but she needed people, always people, to bring it out, with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away, lunching, dining, giving these incessant parties of hers, talking nonsense, sayings things she didn't mean, blunting the edge of her mind, losing her discrimination.
There she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to Dalloway they knew the most appalling bores in Europe
or in came Elizabeth and everything must give way to HER.
She was at a High School
And now Elizabeth was out, presumably; thought him an old fogy, laughed at her mother's friends.
Ah well, so be it.
The compensation of growing old, Peter Walsh thought, coming out of Regent's Park, and holding his hat in hand, was simply this; that the passions remain as strong as ever, but one has gained at last!
the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence the power of taking hold of experience, of turning it round, slowly, in the light.
A terrible confession it was he put his hat on again
but now, at the age of fifty three one scarcely needed people any more.
Life itself, every moment of it, every drop of it, here, this instant, now, in the sun, in Regent's Park, was enough.
Too much indeed.
A whole lifetime was too short to bring out, now that one had acquired the power, the full flavour;
to extract every ounce of pleasure, every shade of meaning
It was impossible that he should ever suffer again as Clarissa had made him suffer.
For hours at a time
pray God that one might say these things without being overheard!
for hours and days he never thought of Daisy.
Could it be that he was in love with her then, remembering the misery, the torture, the extraordinary passion of those days?
It was a different thing altogether a much pleasanter thing the truth being, of course, that now SHE was in love with HIM.
And that perhaps was the reason why, when the ship actually sailed, he felt an extraordinary relief, wanted nothing so much as to be alone; was annoyed to find all her little attentions cigars, notes, a rug for the voyage in his cabin.
Every one if they were honest would say the same;
one doesn't want people after fifty;
one doesn't want to go on telling women they are pretty;
that's what most men of fifty would say, Peter Walsh thought, if they were honest.
But then these astonishing accesses of emotion bursting into tears this morning, what was all that about?
What could Clarissa have thought of him?
thought him a fool presumably, not for the first time.
It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it
jealousy which survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought, holding his pocket knife at arm's length.
She had been meeting Major Orde,
Daisy said in her last letter;
said it on purpose he knew;
said it to make him jealous;
he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him;
yet it made no difference; he was furious!
All this pother of coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her,
to prevent her from marrying anybody else.
That was what tortured him,
that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was;
realising what she might have spared him, what she had reduced him to a whimpering, snivelling old ass.
But women, he thought, shutting his pocket knife, don't know what passion is.
They don't know the meaning of it to men.
Clarissa was as cold as an icicle.
There she would sit on the sofa by his side, let him take her hand, give him one kiss
Here he was at the crossing.
A sound interrupted him;
a frail quivering sound, a voice bubbling up without direction, vigour, beginning or end, running weakly and shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo 
the voice of no age or sex,
the voice of an ancient spring spouting from the earth;
which issued, just opposite Regent's Park Tube station from a tall quivering shape, like a funnel, like a rusty pump, like a wind beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze.
Through all ages when the pavement was grass,
when it was swamp,
through the age of tusk and mammoth, through the age of silent sunrise, the battered woman for she wore a skirt with her right hand exposed, her left clutching at her side, stood singing of love
love which has lasted a million years, she sang,
love which prevails, and millions of years ago, her lover, who had been dead these centuries, had walked, she crooned, with her in May;
but in the course of ages, long as summer days, and flaming, she remembered, with nothing but red asters,
he had gone;
death's enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills, and when at last she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth, now become a mere cinder of ice,
she implored the Gods to lay by her side a bunch of purple heather,
there on her high burial place which the last rays of the last sun caressed;
for then the pageant of the universe would be over.
As the ancient song bubbled up opposite Regent's Park Tube station still the earth seemed green and flowery;
still, though it issued from so rude a mouth, a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted with root fibres and tangled grasses, still the old bubbling burbling song, soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages, and skeletons and treasure, streamed away in rivulets over the pavement and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards Euston, fertilising, leaving a damp stain.
Still remembering how once in some primeval May she had walked with her lover,
this rusty pump, this battered old woman with one hand exposed for coppers the other clutching her side, would still be there in ten million years, remembering how once she had walked in May,
where the sea flows now, with whom
it did not matter
he was a man,
oh yes, a man who had loved her.
But the passage of ages had blurred the clarity of that ancient May day;
the bright petalled flowers were hoar and silver frosted;
she no longer saw,
when she implored him as she did now quite clearly look in my eyes with thy sweet eyes intently,
she no longer saw brown eyes, black whiskers or sunburnt face
but only a looming shape, a shadow shape, to which, with the bird like freshness of the very aged she still twittered
give me your hand and let me press it gently
Peter Walsh couldn't help giving the poor creature a coin as he stepped into his taxi
all peering inquisitive eyes seemed blotted out, and the passing generations the pavement was crowded with bustling middle class people vanished, like leaves, to be trodden under, to be soaked and steeped and made mould of by that eternal spring ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo
Poor old woman, said Rezia Warren Smith, waiting to cross.
Oh poor old wretch!
Suppose it was a wet night?
Suppose one's father, or somebody who had known one in better days had happened to pass, and saw one standing there in the gutter?
And where did she sleep at night?
Cheerfully, almost gaily, the invincible thread of sound wound up into the air like the smoke from a cottage chimney, winding up clean beech trees and issuing in a tuft of blue smoke among the topmost leaves.
And if some one should see, what matter they?
Since she was so unhappy, for weeks and weeks now, Rezia had given meanings to things that happened, almost felt sometimes that she must stop people in the street,
if they looked good, kind people,
and this old woman singing in the street if some one should see, what matter they?
made her suddenly quite sure that everything was going to be right.
They were going to Sir William Bradshaw;
she thought his name sounded nice;
And then there was a brewer's cart, and the grey horses had upright bristles of straw in their tails; there were newspaper placards.
It was a silly, silly dream, being unhappy.
So they crossed, Mr. and Mrs. Septimus Warren Smith, and was there, after all, anything to draw attention to them, anything to make a passer by suspect here is a young man who carries in him the greatest message in the world, and is, moreover, the happiest man in the world, and the most miserable?
Perhaps they walked more slowly than other people,
there was something hesitating, trailing, in the man's walk,
but what more natural for a clerk, who has not been in the West End on a weekday at this hour for years, than to keep looking at the sky, looking at this, that and the other,
as if Portland Place were a room he had come into when the family are away,
the chandeliers being hung in holland bags, and the caretaker, as she lets in long shafts of dusty light upon deserted, queer looking armchairs, lifting one corner of the long blinds, explains to the visitors what a wonderful place it is;
how wonderful, but at the same time, he thinks, as he looks at chairs and tables, how strange.
To look at, he might have been a clerk,
but of the better sort; for he wore brown boots
his hands were educated;
so, too, his profile his angular, big nosed, intelligent, sensitive profile; but not his lips altogether, for they were loose;
his eyes as eyes tend to be , eyes merely; hazel, large;
so that he was, on the whole, a border case, neither one thing nor the other, might end with a house at Purley and a motor car, or continue renting apartments in back streets all his life;
one of those half educated, self educated men whose education is all learnt from books borrowed from public libraries, read in the evening after the day's work, on the advice of well known authors consulted by letter.
As for the other experiences, the solitary ones, which people go through alone, in their bedrooms, in their offices, walking the fields and the streets of London, he had them;
had left home, a mere boy,
because of his mother;
she lied;
because he came down to tea for the fiftieth time with his hands unwashed;
because he could see no future for a poet in Stroud;
so, making a confidant of his little sister, had gone to London leaving an absurd note behind him,
such as great men have written, and the world has read later when the story of their struggles has become famous.
London has swallowed up many millions of young men called Smith;
thought nothing of fantastic Christian names like Septimus with which their parents have thought to distinguish them.
Lodging off the Euston Road, there were experiences, again experiences,
such as change a face in two years from a pink innocent oval to a face lean, contracted, hostile.
But of all this what could the most observant of friends have said except what a gardener says
when he opens the conservatory door in the morning and finds a new blossom on his plant:
It has flowered; flowered from vanity, ambition, idealism, passion, loneliness, courage, laziness, the usual seeds, which all muddled up in a room off the Euston Road , made him shy, and stammering, made him anxious to improve himself, made him fall in love with Miss Isabel Pole, lecturing in the Waterloo Road upon Shakespeare.
Was he not like Keats?
she asked; and reflected how she might give him a taste of Antony and Cleopatra and the rest;
lent him books; wrote him scraps of letters; and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime, without heat, flickering a red gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over Miss Pole;
Antony and Cleopatra; and the Waterloo Road.
He thought her beautiful, believed her impeccably wise;
dreamed of her, wrote poems to her, which, ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink;
he saw her, one summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square.
It has flowered, the gardener might have said, had he opened the door; had he come in, that is to say, any night about this time, and found him writing;
found him tearing up his writing;
found him finishing a masterpiece at three o'clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets, and visiting churches, and fasting one day, drinking another, devouring Shakespeare, Darwin, The History of Civilisation, and Bernard Shaw.
Something was up, Mr. Brewer knew;
Mr. Brewer, managing clerk at Sibleys and Arrowsmiths, auctioneers, valuers, land and estate agents; something was up, he thought, and, being paternal with his young men, and thinking very highly of Smith's abilities, and prophesying that he would, in ten or fifteen years, succeed to the leather arm chair in the inner room under the skylight with the deed boxes round him,
if he keeps his health,
advised football, invited him to supper and was seeing his way to consider recommending a rise of salary, when something happened which threw out many of Mr. Brewer's calculations,
took away his ablest young fellows, and eventually, so prying and insidious were the fingers of the European War, smashed a plaster cast of Ceres, ploughed a hole in the geranium beds, and utterly ruined the cook's nerves at Mr. Brewer's establishment at Muswell Hill.
Septimus was one of the first to volunteer.
He went to France to save an England which consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare's plays and Miss Isabel Pole in a green dress walking in a square.
There in the trenches the change which Mr. Brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly;
he developed manliness; he was promoted; he drew the attention, indeed the affection of his officer, Evans by name.
It was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth rug;
one worrying a paper screw, snarling, snapping, giving a pinch, now and then, at the old dog's ear; the other lying somnolent, blinking at the fire, raising a paw, turning and growling good temperedly.
They had to be together, share with each other, fight with each other, quarrel with each other.
But when Evans when Evans was killed, just before the Armistice, in Italy, Septimus, far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship, congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably.
Rezia who had only seen him once called him a quiet man, a sturdy red haired man, undemonstrative in the company of women ,
The War had taught him.
It was sublime.
He had gone through the whole show, friendship, European War, death, had won promotion, was still under thirty and was bound to survive.
He was right there.
The last shells missed him.
He watched them explode with indifference.
When peace came he was in Milan, billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard, flowers in tubs, little tables in the open, daughters making hats, and to Lucrezia, the younger daughter, he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him
he could not feel.
For now that it was all over, truce signed, and the dead buried, he had, especially in the evening, these sudden thunder claps of fear.
He could not feel.
As he opened the door of the room where the Italian girls sat making hats, he could see them;
could hear them;
they were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers;
they were turning buckram shapes this way and that; the table was all strewn with feathers, spangles, silks, ribbons; scissors were rapping on the table; but something failed him; he could not feel.
Still, scissors rapping, girls laughing, hats being made protected him; he was assured of safety; he had a refuge.
But he could not sit there all night.
There were moments of waking in the early morning.
The bed was falling;
he was falling.
Oh for the scissors and the lamplight and the buckram shapes!
He asked Lucrezia to marry him, the younger of the two, the gay, the frivolous, with those little artist's fingers that she would hold up and say
It is all in them.
Silk, feathers, what not were alive to them.
when they walked out together.
It is the hat that matters most, she would say,
Every hat that passed, she would examine; and the cloak and the dress and the way the woman held herself.
Ill dressing, over dressing she stigmatised, not savagely, rather with impatient movements of the hands, like those of a painter who puts from him some obvious well meant glaring imposture;
then, generously, but always critically, she would welcome a shopgirl who had turned her little bit of stuff gallantly, or praise, wholly, with enthusiastic and professional understanding, a French lady descending from her carriage, in chinchilla, robes, pearls.
Beautiful!
she would murmur, nudging Septimus, that he might see.
But beauty was behind a pane of glass.
Even taste Rezia liked ices, chocolates, sweet things had no relish to him.
He put down his cup on the little marble table.
He looked at people outside; happy they seemed, collecting in the middle of the street, shouting, laughing, squabbling over nothing.
But he could not taste,
he could not feel.
In the tea shop among the tables and the chattering waiters the appalling fear came over him
he could not feel.
He could reason;
he could read, Dante for example, quite easily Septimus, do put down your book, said Rezia,
gently shutting the Inferno ,
he could add up his bill; his brain was perfect;
it must be the fault of the world then
that he could not feel.
The English are so silent, Rezia said.
She liked it, she said.
She respected these Englishmen, and wanted to see London, and the English horses, and the tailor made suits, and could remember hearing how wonderful the shops were, from an Aunt who had married and lived in Soho.
It might be possible, Septimus thought, looking at England from the train window, as they left Newhaven; it might be possible that the world itself is without meaning.
At the office they advanced him to a post of considerable responsibility.
They were proud of him;
he had won crosses.
You have done your duty; it is up to us began Mr. Brewer;
could not finish, so pleasurable was his emotion.
They took admirable lodgings off the Tottenham Court Road.
Here he opened Shakespeare once more.
That boy's business of the intoxication of language
Antony and Cleopatra had shrivelled utterly.
How Shakespeare loathed humanity
the putting on of clothes, the getting of children,
the sordidity of the mouth and the belly!
This was now revealed to Septimus;
the message hidden in the beauty of words.
The secret signal which one generation passes, under disguise, to the next is loathing, hatred, despair.
Dante the same.
Aeschylus translated the same.
There Rezia sat at the table trimming hats.
She trimmed hats for Mrs. Filmer's friends; she trimmed hats by the hour.
She looked pale, mysterious, like a lily, drowned, under water, he thought.
The English are so serious, she would say,
putting her arms round Septimus, her cheek against his.
Love between man and woman was repulsive to Shakespeare.
The business of copulation was filth to him before the end.
But, Rezia said, she must have children.
They had been married five years.
They went to the Tower together;
to the Victoria and Albert Museum;
stood in the crowd to see the King open Parliament.
And there were the shops hat shops, dress shops, shops with leather bags in the window, where she would stand staring.
But she must have a boy.
She must have a son like Septimus, she said.
But nobody could be like Septimus; so gentle; so serious; so clever.
Could she not read Shakespeare too?
Was Shakespeare a difficult author? she asked.
One cannot bring children into a world like this.
One cannot perpetuate suffering, or increase the breed of these lustful animals, who have no lasting emotions, but only whims and vanities, eddying them now this way, now that.
He watched her snip, shape, as one watches a bird hop,
flit in the grass, without daring to move a finger.
For the truth is let her ignore it that human beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor charity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment.
They hunt in packs.
Their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming into the wilderness.
They desert the fallen.
They are plastered over with grimaces.
There was Brewer at the office, with his waxed moustache, coral tie pin, white slip, and pleasurable emotions all coldness and clamminess within his geraniums ruined in the War his cook's nerves destroyed;
or Amelia What'shername, handing round cups of tea punctually at five a leering, sneering obscene little harpy; and the Toms and Berties in their starched shirt fronts oozing thick drops of vice.
They never saw him drawing pictures of them naked at their antics in his notebook.
In the street, vans roared past him; brutality blared out on placards; men were trapped in mines;
women burnt alive;
once a maimed file of lunatics being exercised or displayed for the diversion of the populace who laughed aloud , ambled and nodded and grinned past him, in the Tottenham Court Road, each half apologetically, yet triumphantly, inflicting his hopeless woe.
And would HE go mad?
At tea Rezia told him that Mrs. Filmer's daughter was expecting a baby.
SHE could not grow old and have no children!
She was very lonely, she was very unhappy!
She cried for the first time since they were married.
Far away he heard her sobbing;
he heard it accurately,
he noticed it distinctly; he compared it to a piston thumping.
But he felt nothing.
His wife was crying, and he felt nothing;
only each time she sobbed in this profound, this silent, this hopeless way, he descended another step into the pit.
At last, with a melodramatic gesture which he assumed mechanically and with complete consciousness of its insincerity, he dropped his head on his hands.
Now he had surrendered;
now other people must help him.
People must be sent for.
He gave in.
Nothing could rouse him.
Rezia put him to bed.
She sent for a doctor
Mrs. Filmer's Dr. Holmes.
Dr. Holmes examined him.
There was nothing whatever the matter, said Dr. Holmes.
Oh, what a relief!
What a kind man, what a good man! thought Rezia.
When he felt like that he went to the Music Hall, said Dr. Holmes.
He took a day off with his wife and played golf.
Why not try two tabloids of bromide dissolved in a glass of water at bedtime?
These old Bloomsbury houses, said Dr. Holmes, tapping the wall, are often full of very fine panelling, which the landlords have the folly to paper over.
Only the other day, visiting a patient, Sir Somebody Something in Bedford Square 
nothing whatever the matter, except the sin for which human nature had condemned him to death; that he did not feel.
He had not cared when Evans was killed;
that was worst;
but all the other crimes raised their heads and shook their fingers and jeered and sneered over the rail of the bed in the early hours of the morning at the prostrate body which lay realising its degradation;
how he had married his wife without loving her;
had lied to her; seduced her; outraged Miss Isabel Pole, and was so pocked and marked with vice that women shuddered when they saw him in the street.
The verdict of human nature on such a wretch was death.
Dr. Holmes came again.
Large, fresh coloured, handsome, flicking his boots, looking in the glass, he brushed it all aside headaches, sleeplessness, fears, dreams nerve symptoms and nothing more, he said.
If Dr. Holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven stone six, he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at breakfast.
Rezia would learn to cook porridge.
But, he continued, health is largely a matter in our own control.
Throw yourself into outside interests;
take up some hobby.
He opened Shakespeare
Antony and Cleopatra;
pushed Shakespeare aside.
Some hobby, said Dr. Holmes, for did he not owe his own excellent health and he worked as hard as any man in London to the fact that he could always switch off from his patients on to old furniture?
And what a very pretty comb, if he might say so, Mrs. Warren Smith was wearing!
When the damned fool came again, Septimus refused to see him.
Did he indeed? said Dr. Holmes, smiling agreeably.
Really he had to give that charming little lady, Mrs. Smith, a friendly push before he could get past her into her husband's bedroom.
So you're in a funk, he said agreeably, sitting down by his patient's side.
He had actually talked of killing himself to his wife, quite a girl, a foreigner, wasn't she?
Didn't that give her a very odd idea of English husbands?
Didn't one owe perhaps a duty to one's wife?
Wouldn't it be better to do something instead of lying in bed?
For he had had forty years' experience behind him; and Septimus could take Dr. Holmes's word for it there was nothing whatever the matter with him.
And next time Dr. Holmes came he hoped to find Smith out of bed and not making that charming little lady his wife anxious about him.
Human nature, in short, was on him
the repulsive brute, with the blood red nostrils.
Holmes was on him.
Dr. Holmes came quite regularly every day.
Once you stumble, Septimus wrote on the back of a postcard, human nature is on you.
Their only chance was to escape, without letting Holmes know; to Italy
anywhere, anywhere, away from Dr. Holmes.
But Rezia could not understand him.
Dr. Holmes was such a kind man.
He was so interested in Septimus.
He only wanted to help them, he said.
He had four little children and he had asked her to tea, she told Septimus.
So he was deserted.
The whole world was clamouring:
Kill yourself, kill yourself, for our sakes.
But why should he kill himself for their sakes?
Food was pleasant; the sun hot;
this killing oneself, how does one set about it, with a table knife, uglily, with floods of blood
by sucking a gaspipe?
He was too weak;
he could scarcely raise his hand.
Besides, now that he was quite alone, condemned, deserted, as those who are about to die are alone, there was a luxury in it, an isolation full of sublimity; a freedom which the attached can never know.
Holmes had won of course;
the brute with the red nostrils had won.
But even Holmes himself could not touch this last relic straying on the edge of the world, this outcast, who gazed back at the inhabited regions, who lay, like a drowned sailor, on the shore of the world.
It was at that moment Rezia gone shopping that the great revelation took place.
A voice spoke from behind the screen.
Evans was speaking.
The dead were with him.
Evans, Evans! he cried.
Mr. Smith was talking aloud to himself, Agnes the servant girl cried to Mrs. Filmer in the kitchen. Evans, Evans, he had said as she brought in the tray.
She jumped, she did.
She scuttled downstairs.
And Rezia came in, with her flowers, and walked across the room, and put the roses in a vase, upon which the sun struck directly, and it went laughing, leaping round the room.
She had had to buy the roses, Rezia said, from a poor man in the street.
But they were almost dead already, she said, arranging the roses.
So there was a man outside;
Evans presumably; and the roses, which Rezia said were half dead, had been picked by him in the fields of Greece.
Communication is health; communication is happiness,
communication he muttered.
What are you saying, Septimus?
Rezia asked, wild with terror, for he was talking to himself.
She sent Agnes running for Dr. Holmes.
Her husband, she said, was mad.
He scarcely knew her. You brute! You brute! cried Septimus, seeing human nature, that is Dr. Holmes, enter the room.
Now what's all this about? said Dr. Holmes in the most amiable way in the world.
Talking nonsense to frighten your wife?
But he would give him something to make him sleep.
And if they were rich people, said Dr. Holmes, looking ironically round the room, by all means let them go to Harley Street; if they had no confidence in him, said Dr. Holmes, looking not quite so kind.
It was precisely twelve o'clock;
twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the seagulls twelve o'clock struck as Clarissa Dalloway laid her green dress on her bed, and the Warren Smiths walked down Harley Street.
Twelve was the hour of their appointment.
Probably, Rezia thought, that was Sir William Bradshaw's house with the grey motor car in front of it.
Indeed it was
Sir William Bradshaw's motor car;
low, powerful, grey with plain initials' interlocked on the panel, as if the pomps of heraldry were incongruous,
this man being the ghostly helper, the priest of science; and, as the motor car was grey, so to match its sober suavity, grey furs, silver grey rugs were heaped in it, to keep her ladyship warm while she waited.
For often Sir William would travel sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich, the afflicted, who could afford the very large fee which Sir William very properly charged for his advice.
Her ladyship waited with the rugs about her knees an hour or more, leaning back, thinking sometimes of the patient, sometimes, excusably, of the wall of gold, mounting minute by minute while she waited;
the wall of gold that was mounting between them and all shifts and anxieties she had borne them bravely;
they had had their struggles until she felt wedged on a calm ocean, where only spice winds blow;
respected, admired, envied, with scarcely anything left to wish for, though she regretted her stoutness;
large dinner parties every Thursday night to the profession
an occasional bazaar to be opened
Royalty greeted
too little time, alas, with her husband, whose work grew and grew;
a boy doing well at Eton
she would have liked a daughter too
interests she had, however, in plenty
child welfare
the after care of the epileptic
and photography
so that if there was a church building, or a church decaying, she bribed the sexton, got the key and took photographs
which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals, while she waited.
Sir William himself was no longer young.
He had worked very hard;
he had won his position by sheer ability being the son of a shopkeeper ;
loved his profession; made a fine figurehead at ceremonies and spoke well
all of which had by the time he was knighted given him a heavy look, a weary look the stream of patients being so incessant, the responsibilities and privileges of his profession so onerous , which weariness, together with his grey hairs, increased the extraordinary distinction of his presence and gave him the reputation of the utmost importance in dealing with nerve cases not merely of lightning skill, and almost infallible accuracy in diagnosis but of sympathy; tact; understanding of the human soul.
He could see the first moment they came into the room the Warren Smiths they were called ;
he was certain directly he saw the man; it was a case of extreme gravity.
It was a case of complete breakdown complete physical and nervous breakdown, with every symptom in an advanced stage, he ascertained in two or three minutes writing answers to questions, murmured discreetly, on a pink card .
How long had Dr. Holmes been attending him?
Six weeks.
Prescribed a little bromide?
Said there was nothing the matter?
Ah yes those general practitioners! thought Sir William.
It took half his time to undo their blunders.
Some were irreparable .
You served with great distinction in the War?
The patient repeated the word war interrogatively.
He was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind.
A serious symptom, to be noted on the card.
The War? the patient asked.
The European War that little shindy of schoolboys with gunpowder?
Had he served with distinction?
He really forgot.
In the War itself he had failed.
Yes, he served with the greatest distinction, Rezia assured the doctor;
he was promoted.
And they have the very highest opinion of you at your office? Sir William murmured, glancing at Mr. Brewer's very generously worded letter.
So that you have nothing to worry you, no financial anxiety, nothing?
He had committed an appalling crime and been condemned to death by human nature.
I have I have, he began,
committed a crime
He has done nothing wrong whatever, Rezia assured the doctor.
It was merely a question of rest, said Sir William; of rest, rest, rest; a long rest in bed.
There was a delightful home down in the country where her husband would be perfectly looked after.
Away from her? she asked.
Unfortunately, yes; the people we care for most are not good for us when we are ill.
But he was not mad,
was he?
Sir William said he never spoke of madness; he called it not having a sense of proportion.
But her husband did not like doctors.
He would refuse to go there.
Shortly and kindly Sir William explained to her the state of the case.
He had threatened to kill himself.
There was no alternative.
It was a question of law.
He would lie in bed in a beautiful house in the country.
The nurses were admirable.
Sir William would visit him once a week.
If Mrs. Warren Smith was quite sure she had no more questions to ask
he never hurried his patients
they would return to her husband.
She had nothing more to ask not of Sir William.
So they returned to the most exalted of mankind;
the criminal who faced his judges;
the victim exposed on the heights; the fugitive; the drowned sailor; the poet of the immortal ode;
the Lord who had gone from life to death; to Septimus Warren Smith, who sat in the arm chair under the skylight staring at a photograph of Lady Bradshaw in Court dress, muttering messages about beauty.
We have had our little talk, said Sir William.
He says you are very, very ill, Rezia cried.
We have been arranging that you should go into a home, said Sir William.
One of Holmes's homes? sneered Septimus.
The fellow made a distasteful impression.
For there was in Sir William, whose father had been a tradesman,
a natural respect for breeding and clothing, which shabbiness nettled; again, more profoundly, there was in Sir William, who had never had time for reading, a grudge, deeply buried, against cultivated people who came into his room and intimated that doctors, whose profession is a constant strain upon all the highest faculties, are not educated men.
One of MY homes, Mr. Warren Smith, he said, where we will teach you to rest.
And there was just one thing more.
He was quite certain that when Mr. Warren Smith was well
he was the last man in the world to frighten his wife.
But he had talked of killing himself.
We all have our moments of depression, said Sir William.
Once you fall, Septimus repeated to himself, human nature is on you.
Holmes and Bradshaw are on you.
They scour the desert.
They fly screaming into the wilderness.
The rack and the thumbscrew are applied.
Human nature is remorseless.
Impulses came upon him sometimes?
Sir William asked, with his pencil on a pink card.
That was his own affair, said Septimus.
Nobody lives for himself alone, said Sir William, glancing at the photograph of his wife in Court dress.
And you have a brilliant career before you, said Sir William.
There was Mr. Brewer's letter on the table.
An exceptionally brilliant career.
But if he confessed?
If he communicated?
Would they let him off then, his torturers?
I I he stammered.
But what was his crime?
He could not remember it.
Yes?
Sir William encouraged him.
Love, trees, there is no crime
what was his message?
I I Septimus stammered.
Really, he was not fit to be about.
Try to think as little about yourself as possible, said Sir William kindly.
Was there anything else they wished to ask him?
Sir William would make all arrangements he murmured to Rezia and he would let her know between five and six that evening he murmured.
Trust everything to me, he said, and dismissed them.
Never, never had Rezia felt such agony in her life!
She had asked for help and been deserted!
He had failed them!
Sir William Bradshaw was not a nice man.
The upkeep of that motor car alone must cost him quite a lot, said Septimus, when they got out into the street.
She clung to his arm.
They had been deserted.
But what more did she want?
To his patients he gave three quarters of an hour;
if in this exacting science which has to do with what, after all, we know nothing about the nervous system, the human brain a doctor loses his sense of proportion, as a doctor he fails.
Health we must have;
health is proportion;
so that when a man comes into your room and says he is Christ a common delusion , and has a message, as they mostly have, and threatens, as they often do, to kill himself, you invoke proportion; order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and rest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six months' rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve.
Proportion, divine proportion, Sir William's goddess, was acquired by Sir William walking hospitals, catching salmon, begetting one son in Harley Street by Lady Bradshaw, who caught salmon herself and took photographs scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals.
Worshipping proportion, Sir William not only prospered himself but made England prosper, secluded her lunatics, forbade childbirth, penalised despair, made it impossible for the unfit to propagate their views until they, too, shared his sense of proportion his, if they were men,
Lady Bradshaw's if they were women she embroidered, knitted, spent four nights out of seven at home with her son ,
so that not only did his colleagues respect him,
his subordinates fear him,
but the friends and relations of his patients felt for him the keenest gratitude for insisting that these prophetic Christs and Christesses, who prophesied the end of the world, or the advent of God, should drink milk in bed, as Sir William ordered; Sir William with his thirty years' experience of these kinds of cases, and his infallible instinct, this is madness, this sense; in fact, his sense of proportion.
But Proportion has a sister, less smiling, more formidable, a Goddess even now engaged
in the heat and sands of India, the mud and swamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols, and setting up in their place her own stern countenance.
Conversion is her name
she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace.
At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching;
shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power;
smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own.
This lady too Rezia Warren Smith divined it had her dwelling in Sir William's heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice.
How he would work
how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate institutions!
But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will.
For example, Lady Bradshaw.
Fifteen years ago she had gone under.
It was nothing you could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water logged, of her will into his.
Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane.
Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe
that the poor lady lied.
Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely:
now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband's eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of the head which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life, Lady Bradshaw said, is not his own but his patients' disagreeable it was:
so that guests, when the clock struck ten, breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients.
There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the valuable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the extent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm chairs, they watched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with the arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to prove if the patient was obstinate that Sir William was master of his own actions, which the patient was not.
There some weakly broke down; sobbed, submitted;
others, inspired by Heaven knows what intemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable humbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself.
Why live?
Sir William replied that life was good.
Certainly Lady Bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year.
But to us, they protested, life has given no such bounty.
He acquiesced.
They lacked a sense of proportion.
And perhaps, after all, there is no God?
He shrugged his shoulders.
In short, this living or not living is an affair of our own?
But there they were mistaken.
Sir William had a friend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted was a difficult art
a sense of proportion.
There were, moreover, family affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career.
All of these had in Sir William a resolute champion.
If they failed him,
he had to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked very quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial impulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were held in control.
And then stole out from her hiding place and mounted her throne that Goddess whose lust is to override opposition, to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself.
Naked, defenceless, the exhausted, the friendless received the impress of Sir William's will.
He swooped;
he devoured.
He shut people up.
It was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared Sir William so greatly to the relations of his victims.
But Rezia Warren Smith cried, walking down Harley Street, that she did not like that man.
Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counselled submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion, until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock, suspended above a shop in Oxford Street, announced, genially and fraternally, as if it were a pleasure to Messrs.
Rigby and Lowndes to give the information gratis, that it was half past one.
Looking up, it appeared that each letter of their names stood for one of the hours;
subconsciously one was grateful to Rigby and Lowndes for giving one time ratified by Greenwich;
this gratitude so Hugh Whitbread ruminated, dallying there in front of the shop window , naturally took the form later of buying off Rigby and Lowndes socks or shoes.
So he ruminated.
It was his habit.
He did not go deeply.
He brushed surfaces; the dead languages, the living, life in Constantinople, Paris, Rome; riding, shooting, tennis, it had been once.
The malicious asserted that he now kept guard at Buckingham Palace, dressed in silk stockings and knee breeches, over what nobody knew.
But he did it extremely efficiently.
He had been afloat on the cream of English society for fifty five years.
He had known Prime Ministers.
His affections were understood to be deep.
if it were true that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the time or held important office, one or two humble reforms stood to his credit;
an improvement in public shelters was one;
the protection of owls in Norfolk another;
servant girls had reason to be grateful to him;
his name at the end of letters to the Times, asking for funds, appealing to the public to protect, to preserve, to clear up litter, to abate smoke, and stamp out immorality in parks, commanded respect.
A magnificent figure he cut too, pausing for a moment
as the sound of the half hour died away to look critically, magisterially, at socks and shoes; impeccable, substantial, as if he beheld the world from a certain eminence, and dressed to match;
but realised the obligations which size, wealth, health, entail, and observed punctiliously even when not absolutely necessary, little courtesies, old fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner, something to imitate, something to remember him by,
for he would never lunch, for example, with Lady Bruton, whom he had known these twenty years, without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch of carnations and asking Miss Brush, Lady Bruton's secretary, after her brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush, deficient though she was in every attribute of female charm, so much resented that she said
Thank you, he's doing very well in South Africa,
Lady Bruton herself preferred Richard Dalloway, who arrived at the next moment.
Indeed they met on the doorstep.
Lady Bruton preferred Richard Dalloway of course.
He was made of much finer material.
But she wouldn't let them run down her poor dear Hugh.
She could never forget his kindness
he had been really remarkably kind
she forgot precisely upon what occasion.
But he had been remarkably kind.
Anyhow, the difference between one man and another does not amount to much.
She had never seen the sense of cutting people up, as Clarissa Dalloway did
cutting them up and sticking them together again; not at any rate when one was sixty two.
She took Hugh's carnations with her angular grim smile.
There was nobody else coming, she said.
She had got them there on false pretences, to help her out of a difficulty 
But let us eat first, she said.
so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro through swing doors of aproned white capped maids, handmaidens not of necessity, but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by hostesses in Mayfair from one thirty to two, when, with a wave of the hand, the traffic ceases, and there rises instead this profound illusion
in the first place about the food how it is not paid for;
then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and silver, little mats, saucers of red fruit; films of brown cream mask turbot; in casseroles severed chickens swim; coloured, undomestic, the fire burns; and with the wine and the coffee not paid for rise jocund visions before musing eyes; gently speculative eyes;
eyes to whom life appears musical, mysterious; eyes now kindled to observe genially the beauty of the red carnations which Lady Bruton whose movements were always angular had laid beside her plate,
so that Hugh Whitbread, feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the same time completely sure of his standing, said, resting his fork,
Wouldn't they look charming against your lace?
Miss Brush resented this familiarity intensely.
She thought him an underbred fellow.
She made Lady Bruton laugh.
Lady Bruton raised the carnations,
holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the General held the scroll in the picture behind her;
Which was she now, the General's great grand daughter?
great great grand daughter?
Sir Roderick, Sir Miles, Sir Talbot that was it.
It was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women.
She should have been a general of dragoons herself.
And Richard would have served under her, cheerfully;
he had the greatest respect for her;
he cherished these romantic views about well set up old women of pedigree, and would have liked, in his good humoured way, to bring some young hot heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her;
as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea drinking enthusiasts!
He knew her country.
He knew her people.
There was a vine, still bearing, which either Lovelace or Herrick she never read a word poetry of herself, but so the story ran had sat under.
Better wait to put before them the question that bothered her about making an appeal to the public; if so, in what terms and so on ,
better wait until they have had their coffee, Lady Bruton thought; and so laid the carnations down beside her plate.
How's Clarissa?
she asked abruptly.
Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her.
Indeed, Lady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people;
of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs.
Certainly there was an alcove in her drawing room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that table of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written there one evening in the eighties in Lady Bruton's presence, with her cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British troops to advance upon an historical occasion.
She kept the pen and told the story. Thus, when she said in her offhand way How's Clarissa?
husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed, however devoted, were secretly doubtful themselves, of her interest in women who often got in their husbands' way, prevented them from accepting posts abroad, and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza.
Nevertheless her inquiry, How's Clarissa? was known by women infallibly, to be a signal from a well wisher, from an almost silent companion, whose utterances half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime signified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath masculine lunch parties and united Lady Bruton and Mrs. Dalloway, who seldom met, and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even hostile, in a singular bond.
I met Clarissa in the Park this morning, said Hugh Whitbread, diving into the casserole, anxious to pay himself this little tribute, for he had only to come to London and he met everybody at once; but greedy, one of the greediest men she had ever known, Milly Brush thought, who observed men with unflinching rectitude, and was capable of everlasting devotion, to her own sex in particular, being knobbed, scraped, angular, and entirely without feminine charm.
D'you know who's in town?
said Lady Bruton suddenly bethinking her.
Our old friend, Peter Walsh.
They all smiled.
Peter Walsh!
And Mr. Dalloway was genuinely glad, Milly Brush thought; and Mr. Whitbread thought only of his chicken.
All three, Lady Bruton, Hugh Whitbread, and Richard Dalloway, remembered the same thing
how passionately Peter had been in love; been rejected; gone to India; come a cropper; made a mess of things;
Richard Dalloway had a very great liking for the dear old fellow too.
Milly Brush saw that; saw a depth in the brown of his eyes; saw him hesitate; consider; which interested her, as Mr. Dalloway always interested her, for what was he thinking, she wondered, about Peter Walsh?
That Peter Walsh had been in love with Clarissa; that he would go back directly after lunch and find Clarissa; that he would tell her, in so many words, that he loved her.
Yes, he would say that.
Milly Brush once might almost have fallen in love with these silences; and Mr. Dalloway was always so dependable; such a gentleman too.
Now, being forty, Lady Bruton had only to nod, or turn her head a little abruptly,
Milly Brush took the signal, however deeply she might be sunk in these reflections of a detached spirit, of an uncorrupted soul whom life could not bamboozle, because life had not offered her a trinket of the slightest value; not a curl, smile, lip, cheek, nose; nothing whatever; Lady Bruton had only to nod, and Perkins was instructed to quicken the coffee.
Yes; Peter Walsh has come back, said Lady Bruton.
It was vaguely flattering to them all.
He had come back, battered, unsuccessful, to their secure shores.
But to help him, they reflected, was impossible;
there was some flaw in his character.
Hugh Whitbread said one might of course mention his name to So and so.
He wrinkled lugubriously, consequentially, at the thought of the letters he would write to the heads of Government offices about my old friend, Peter Walsh, and so on.
But it wouldn't lead to anything not to anything permanent, because of his character.
In trouble with some woman, said Lady Bruton.
They had all guessed that THAT was at the bottom of it.
However, we shall hear the whole story from Peter himself.
The coffee was very slow in coming.
The address?
murmured Hugh Whitbread;
They were waiting to bring the coffee until Mr. Whitbread had finished.
Hugh was very slow, Lady Bruton thought.
He was getting fat, she noticed.
Richard always kept himself in the pink of condition.
She was getting impatient;
the whole of her being was setting positively, undeniably, domineeringly brushing aside all this unnecessary trifling Peter Walsh and his affairs upon that subject which engaged her attention, and not merely her attention,
but that fibre which was the ramrod of her soul, that essential part of her without which Millicent Bruton would not have been Millicent Bruton;
that project for emigrating young people of both sexes born of respectable parents and setting them up with a fair prospect of doing well in Canada.
She exaggerated.
She had perhaps lost her sense of proportion.
Emigration was not to others the obvious remedy, the sublime conception.
It was not to them not to Hugh, or Richard, or even to devoted Miss Brush the liberator of the pent egotism,
a strong martial woman, well nourished, well descended, of direct impulses, downright feelings, and little introspective power broad and simple
why could not every one be broad and simple?
youth is past, and must eject upon some object
it may be Emigration, it may be Emancipation; but whatever it be, this object round which the essence of her soul is daily secreted, becomes inevitably prismatic, lustrous, half looking glass, half precious stone; now carefully hidden in case people should sneer at it; now proudly displayed.
Emigration had become, in short, largely Lady Bruton.
But she had to write.
And one letter to the Times, she used to say to Miss Brush, cost her more than to organise an expedition to South Africa which she had done in the war .
After a morning's battle beginning, tearing up, beginning again, she used to feel the futility of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion, and would turn gratefully to the thought of Hugh Whitbread who possessed no one could doubt it
the art of writing letters to the Times.
A being so differently constituted from herself, with such a command of language; able to put things as editors like them put; had passions which one could not call simply greed.
Lady Bruton often suspended judgement upon men in deference to the mysterious accord in which they, but no woman, stood to the laws of the universe; knew how to put things; knew what was said;
so that if Richard advised her, and Hugh wrote for her, she was sure of being somehow right.
So she let Hugh eat his souffle; asked after poor Evelyn; waited until they were smoking, and then said,
Milly, would you fetch the papers?
And Miss Brush went out, came back;
laid papers on the table; and Hugh produced his fountain pen;
his silver fountain pen, which had done twenty years' service, he said, unscrewing the cap.
It was still in perfect order;
he had shown it to the makers;
there was no reason, they said,
why it should ever wear out; which was somehow to Hugh's credit, and to the credit of the sentiments which his pen expressed so Richard Dalloway felt as Hugh began carefully writing capital letters with rings round them in the margin, and thus marvellously reduced Lady Bruton's tangles to sense, to grammar such as the editor of the Times, Lady Bruton felt, watching the marvellous transformation, must respect.
Hugh was slow.
Hugh was pertinacious.
Richard said one must take risks.
Hugh proposed modifications in deference to people's feelings, which, he said rather tartly when Richard laughed, had to be considered, and read out how, therefore, we are of opinion that the times are ripe...
which Richard thought all stuffing and bunkum,
but no harm in it,
of course, and Hugh went on drafting sentiments in alphabetical order of the highest nobility, brushing the cigar ash from his waistcoat, and summing up now and then the progress they had made until, finally, he read out the draft of a letter which Lady Bruton felt certain was a masterpiece.
Could her own meaning sound like that?
Hugh could not guarantee that the editor would put it in; but he would be meeting somebody at luncheon.
Whereupon Lady Bruton, who seldom did a graceful thing, stuffed all Hugh's carnations into the front of her dress, and flinging her hands out called him
What she would have done without them both she did not know.
They rose.
And Richard Dalloway strolled off as usual to have a look at the General's portrait, because he meant, whenever he had a moment of leisure, to write a history of Lady Bruton's family.
And Millicent Bruton was very proud of her family.
But they could wait, they could wait, she said, looking at the picture;
meaning that her family, of military men, administrators, admirals, had been men of action, who had done their duty;
Richard's first duty was to his country, but it was a fine face, she said;
all the papers were ready for Richard down at Aldmixton whenever the time came; the Labour Government she meant.
Ah, the news from India!
she cried.
And then, as they stood in the hall taking yellow gloves from the bowl on the malachite table and Hugh was offering Miss Brush with quite unnecessary courtesy some discarded ticket or other compliment, which she loathed from the depths of her heart and blushed brick red, Richard turned to Lady Bruton, with his hat in his hand, and said,
We shall see you at our party to night?
whereupon Lady Bruton resumed the magnificence which letter writing had shattered.
She might come
or she might not come.
Clarissa had wonderful energy.
Parties terrified Lady Bruton.
But then, she was getting old.
So she intimated, standing at her doorway
handsome; very erect
while her chow stretched behind her, and Miss Brush disappeared into the background with her hands full of papers.
And Lady Bruton went ponderously, majestically, up to her room, lay, one arm extended, on the sofa.
She sighed, she snored, not that she was asleep, only drowsy and heavy, drowsy and heavy, like a field of clover in the sunshine this hot June day, with the bees going round and about and the yellow butterflies.
Always she went back to those fields down in Devonshire, where she had jumped the brooks on Patty, her pony, with Mortimer and Tom, her brothers.
And there were the dogs; there were the rats; there were her father and mother on the lawn under the trees, with the tea things out, and the beds of dahlias, the hollyhocks, the pampas grass; and they, little wretches, always up to some mischief!
stealing back through the shrubbery, so as not to be seen,
What old nurse used to say about her frocks!
Ah dear, she remembered
it was Wednesday in Brook Street.
Those kind good fellows, Richard Dalloway, Hugh Whitbread, had gone this hot day through the streets whose growl came up to her lying on the sofa.
Power was hers, position, income.
She had lived in the forefront of her time.
She had had good friends
known the ablest men of her day.
Murmuring London flowed up to her, and her hand, lying on the sofa back, curled upon some imaginary baton such as her grandfathers might have held, holding which she seemed, drowsy and heavy, to be commanding battalions marching to Canada
and those good fellows walking across London, that territory of theirs, that little bit of carpet, Mayfair.
And they went further and further from her
being attached to her by a thin thread since they had lunched with her which would stretch and stretch, get thinner and thinner as they walked across London
as if one's friends were attached to one's body, after lunching with them, by a thin thread, which as she dozed there became hazy with the sound of bells, striking the hour or ringing to service, as a single spider's thread is blotted with rain drops, and, burdened, sags down.
So she slept.
And Richard Dalloway and Hugh Whitbread hesitated at the corner of Conduit Street at the very moment that Millicent Bruton, lying on the sofa, let the thread snap; snored.
Contrary winds buffeted at the street corner.
They looked in at a shop window
they did not wish to buy or to talk but to part
only with contrary winds buffeting the street corner, with some sort of lapse in the tides of the body, two forces meeting in a swirl, morning and afternoon, they paused.
Some newspaper placard went up in the air
gallantly, like a kite at first, then paused
swooped, fluttered; and a lady's veil hung.
Yellow awnings trembled.
The speed of the morning traffic slackened
and single carts rattled carelessly down half empty streets.
In Norfolk, of which Richard Dalloway was half thinking, a soft warm wind blew back the petals
confused the waters; ruffled the flowering grasses.
Haymakers, who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the morning toil, parted curtains of green blades
moved trembling globes of cow parsley to see the sky
the blue, the steadfast, the blazing summer sky.
Aware that he was looking at a silver two handled Jacobean mug, and that Hugh Whitbread admired condescendingly with airs of connoisseurship a Spanish necklace which he thought of asking the price of in case Evelyn might like it
still Richard was torpid
could not think or move.
Life had thrown up this wreckage
shop windows full of coloured paste, and one stood stark with the lethargy of the old, stiff with the rigidity of the old, looking in.
Evelyn Whitbread might like to buy this Spanish necklace
so she might.
Yawn he must.
Hugh was going into the shop.
Right you are!
said Richard, following.
Goodness knows he didn't want to go buying necklaces with Hugh.
But there are tides in the body.
Morning meets afternoon.
Borne like a frail shallop on deep, deep floods, Lady Bruton's great grandfather and his memoir and his campaigns in North America were whelmed and sunk.
And Millicent Bruton too.
She went under.
Richard didn't care a straw what became of Emigration
about that letter, whether the editor put it in or not.
The necklace hung stretched between Hugh's admirable fingers.
Let him give it to a girl, if he must buy jewels
any girl, any girl in the street.
For the worthlessness of this life did strike Richard pretty forcibly
buying necklaces for Evelyn.
If he'd had a boy he'd have said, Work, work.
But he had his Elizabeth; he adored his Elizabeth.
I should like to see Mr. Dubonnet,
said Hugh in his curt worldly way.
It appeared that this Dubonnet had the measurements of Mrs. Whitbread's neck, or, more strangely still, knew her views upon Spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line which Hugh could not remember .
All of which seemed to Richard Dalloway awfully odd.
For he never gave Clarissa presents
except a bracelet two or three years ago, which had not been a success.
She never wore it.
It pained him to remember that she never wore it.
And as a single spider's thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf, so Richard's mind, recovering from its lethargy, set now on his wife, Clarissa, whom Peter Walsh had loved so passionately
and Richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon
of himself and Clarissa
of their life together
and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him, and taking up first this brooch then that ring,
How much is that?
he asked
but doubted his own taste.
He wanted to open the drawing room door and come in holding out something
a present for Clarissa.
Only what?
But Hugh was on his legs again.
He was unspeakably pompous.
Really, after dealing here for thirty five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business.
For Dubonnet, it seemed, was out
and Hugh would not buy anything until Mr. Dubonnet chose to be in; at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow.
It was all perfectly correct.
And yet Richard couldn't have said that to save his life!
Why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive.
he would go straight to her, in Westminster.
But he wanted to come in holding something.
Flowers?
Yes, flowers, since he did not trust his taste in gold
any number of flowers, roses, orchids, to celebrate what was, reckoning things as you will, an event
this feeling about her when they spoke of Peter Walsh at luncheon
and they never spoke of it
not for years had they spoken of it
which, he thought, grasping his red and white roses together a vast bunch in tissue paper , is the greatest mistake in the world.
The time comes when it can't be said; one's too shy to say it, he thought, pocketing his sixpence or two of change, setting off with his great bunch held against his body to Westminster to say straight out in so many words , holding out his flowers, I love you.
whatever she might think of him
Why not?
Really it was a miracle thinking of the war, and thousands of poor chaps, with all their lives before them
shovelled together, already half forgotten
it was a miracle.
Here he was walking across London to say to Clarissa in so many words that he loved her.
Which one never does say, he thought.
Partly one's lazy
partly one's shy.
And Clarissa
it was difficult to think of her
except in starts, as at luncheon, when he saw her quite distinctly
their whole life.
He stopped at the crossing
and repeated
being simple by nature, and undebauched, because he had tramped, and shot
being pertinacious and dogged, having championed the down trodden and followed his instincts in the House of Commons
being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless, rather stiff
he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married Clarissa
a miracle his life had been a miracle, he thought
hesitating to cross.
But it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing Piccadilly alone.
The police ought to have stopped the traffic at once.
He had no illusions about the London police.
Indeed, he was collecting evidence of their malpractices; and those costermongers, not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets
and prostitutes, good Lord, the fault wasn't in them, nor in young men either, but in our detestable social system and so forth
all of which he considered, could be seen considering, grey, dogged, dapper, clean, as he walked across the Park to tell his wife that he loved her.
For he would say it in so many words, when he came into the room.
Because it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels, he thought, crossing the Green Park and observing with pleasure how in the shade of the trees whole families, poor families, were sprawling;
children kicking up their legs; sucking milk;
paper bags thrown about, which could easily be picked up if people objected by one of those fat gentlemen in livery;
for he was of opinion that every park, and every square, during the summer months should be open to children
the grass of the park flushed and faded, lighting up the poor mothers of Westminster and their crawling babies, as if a yellow lamp were moved beneath .
But what could be done for female vagrants like that poor creature, stretched on her elbow as if she had flung herself on the earth, rid of all ties, to observe curiously, to speculate boldly, to consider the whys and the wherefores, impudent, loose lipped, humorous , he did not know.
Bearing his flowers like a weapon, Richard Dalloway approached her;
intent he passed her;
still there was time for a spark between them
she laughed at the sight of him, he smiled good humouredly, considering the problem of the female vagrant;
not that they would ever speak.
But he would tell Clarissa that he loved her, in so many words.
He had, once upon a time, been jealous of Peter Walsh;
jealous of him and Clarissa.
But she had often said to him that she had been right not to marry Peter Walsh;
which, knowing Clarissa, was obviously true;
she wanted support.
Not that she was weak; but she wanted support.
As for Buckingham Palace like an old prima donna facing the audience all in white you can't deny it a certain dignity, he considered, nor despise what does, after all, stand to millions of people a little crowd was waiting at the gate to see the King drive out
for a symbol, absurd though it is
a child with a box of bricks could have done better, he thought;
looking at the memorial to Queen Victoria
whom he could remember in her horn spectacles driving through Kensington
its white mound, its billowing motherliness
but he liked being ruled by the descendant of Horsa
he liked continuity
and the sense of handing on the traditions of the past.
It was a great age in which to have lived.
Indeed, his own life was a miracle
let him make no mistake about it
here he was, in the prime of life, walking to his house in Westminster to tell Clarissa that he loved her.
Happiness is this he thought.
It is this, he said, as he entered Dean's Yard.
Big Ben was beginning to strike, first the warning, musical
then the hour, irrevocable.
Lunch parties waste the entire afternoon, he thought, approaching his door.
The sound of Big Ben flooded Clarissa's drawing room, where she sat, ever so annoyed, at her writing table; worried; annoyed.
It was perfectly true that she had not asked Ellie Henderson to her party
but she had done it on purpose.
Now Mrs. Marsham wrote she had told Ellie Henderson she would ask Clarissa
Ellie so much wanted to come.
But why should she invite all the dull women in London to her parties?
Why should Mrs. Marsham interfere?
And there was Elizabeth closeted all this time with Doris Kilman.
Anything more nauseating she could not conceive.
Prayer at this hour with that woman.
And the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave
which receded, and gathered itself together to fall once more, when she heard, distractingly, something fumbling, something scratching at the door.
Who at this hour?
Three, good Heavens!
Three already!
For with overpowering directness and dignity the clock struck three
and she heard nothing else; but the door handle slipped round and in came Richard!
What a surprise!
In came Richard, holding out flowers.
She had failed him, once at Constantinople
and Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.
He was holding out flowers
roses, red and white roses.
But he could not bring himself to say he loved her; not in so many words.
she said, taking his flowers.
She understood
she understood without his speaking; his Clarissa.
She put them in vases on the mantelpiece.
How lovely they looked! she said.
And was it amusing, she asked?
Had Lady Bruton asked after her?
Peter Walsh was back.
Mrs. Marsham had written.
Must she ask Ellie Henderson?
That woman Kilman was upstairs.
But let us sit down for five minutes, said Richard.
It all looked so empty.
All the chairs were against the wall.
What had they been doing?
Oh, it was for the party; no, he had not forgotten, the party.
Peter Walsh was back.
Oh yes; she had had him.
And he was going to get a divorce
and he was in love with some woman out there.
And he hadn't changed in the slightest.
There she was, mending her dress....
Thinking of Bourton, she said.
Hugh was at lunch, said Richard.
She had met him too!
Well, he was getting absolutely intolerable.
Buying Evelyn necklaces
fatter than ever
an intolerable ass.
And it came over me I might have married you,' she said
thinking of Peter sitting there in his little bow tie; with that knife, opening it, shutting it.
He had not said I love you
but he held her hand.
Happiness is this, is this, he thought.
But why should I ask all the dull women in London to my parties? said Clarissa.
And if Mrs. Marsham gave a party, did SHE invite her guests?
Poor Ellie Henderson, said Richard
it was a very odd thing how much Clarissa minded about her parties, he thought.
But Richard had no notion of the look of a room.
However
what was he going to say?
If she worried about these parties he would not let her give them.
Did she wish she had married Peter?
But he must go.
He must be off, he said, getting up.
But he stood for a moment as if he were about to say something
and she wondered what?
There were the roses.
Some Committee? she asked, as he opened the door.
Armenians, he said
or perhaps it was Albanians.
And there is a dignity in people
a solitude
even between husband and wife a gulf
and that one must respect, thought Clarissa, watching him open the door
for one would not part with it oneself, or take it, against his will, from one's husband, without losing one's independence, one's self respect
something, after all, priceless.
He returned with a pillow and a quilt.
An hour's complete rest after luncheon, he said.
And he went.
He would go on saying An hour's complete rest after luncheon to the end of time
because a doctor had ordered it once.
It was like him to take what doctors said literally
part of his adorable, divine simplicity, which no one had to the same extent
which made him go and do the thing while she and Peter frittered their time away bickering.
He was already halfway to the House of Commons, to his Armenians, his Albanians, having settled her on the sofa, looking at his roses.
And people would say, Clarissa Dalloway is spoilt.
She cared much more for her roses than for the Armenians.
Hunted out of existence, maimed, frozen, the victims of cruelty and injustice
she had heard Richard say so over and over again
no, she could feel nothing for the Albanians, or was it the Armenians?
but she loved her roses didn't that help the Armenians?
the only flowers she could bear to see cut.
But Richard was already at the House of Commons
at his Committee
having settled all her difficulties.
But no; alas, that was not true.
He did not see the reasons against asking Ellie Henderson.
She would do it, of course, as he wished it.
Since he had brought the pillows, she would lie down....
But
but
why did she suddenly feel, for no reason that she could discover
desperately unhappy?
As a person who has dropped some grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall blades very carefully, this way and that, and searches here and there vainly
and at last spies it there at the roots, so she went through one thing and another
no, it was not Sally Seton saying that Richard would never be in the Cabinet because he had a second class brain
it came back to her
no, she did not mind that
nor was it to do with Elizabeth either and Doris Kilman
those were facts.
It was a feeling, some unpleasant feeling
earlier in the day perhaps
something that Peter had said, combined with some depression of her own, in her bedroom, taking off her hat
and what Richard had said had added to it
but what had he said?
There were his roses.
Her parties!
That was it!
Her parties!
Both of them criticised her very unfairly, laughed at her very unjustly, for her parties.
Well, how was she going to defend herself?
Now that she knew what it was, she felt perfectly happy.
They thought, or Peter at any rate thought, that she enjoyed imposing herself
liked to have famous people about her
great names; was simply a snob in short.
Well, Peter might think so.
Richard merely thought it foolish of her to like excitement when she knew it was bad for her heart.
both were quite wrong.
What she liked was simply life.
That's what I do it for, she said, speaking aloud, to life.
Since she was lying on the sofa, cloistered, exempt, the presence of this thing which she felt to be so obvious became physically existent; with robes of sound from the street, sunny, with hot breath, whispering, blowing out the blinds.
But suppose Peter said to her, Yes, yes, but your parties
what's the sense of your parties?
all she could say was and nobody could be expected to understand
They're an offering
which sounded horribly vague.
But who was Peter to make out that life was all plain sailing?
Peter always in love, always in love with the wrong woman?
What's your love? she might say to him.
And she knew his answer; how it is the most important thing in the world and no woman possibly understood it.
Very well.
But could any man understand what she meant either?
about life?
She could not imagine Peter or Richard taking the trouble to give a party for no reason whatever.
But to go deeper, beneath what people said and these judgements, how superficial, how fragmentary they are!
in her own mind now, what did it mean to her, this thing she called life?
Oh, it was very queer.
Here was So and so in South Kensington; some one up in Bayswater; and somebody else, say, in Mayfair.
And she felt quite continuously a sense of their existence
and she felt what a waste
and she felt what a pity
and she felt if only they could be brought together
so she did it.
And it was an offering
to combine, to create
but to whom?
An offering for the sake of offering, perhaps.
Anyhow, it was her gift.
Nothing else had she of the slightest importance; could not think, write, even play the piano.
She muddled Armenians and Turks
loved success
hated discomfort
must be liked
talked oceans of nonsense
and to this day, ask her what the Equator was, and she did not know.
All the same, that one day should follow another
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
that one should wake up in the morning
see the sky
walk in the park
meet Hugh Whitbread
then suddenly in came Peter
then these roses
After that, how unbelievable death was!
that it must end
and no one in the whole world would know how she had loved it all
how, every instant...
Elizabeth knew that her mother was resting.
She came in very quietly.
She stood perfectly still.
Was it that some Mongol had been wrecked on the coast of Norfolk as Mrs. Hilbery said , had mixed with the Dalloway ladies, perhaps, a hundred years ago?
For the Dalloways, in general, were fair haired
blue eyed; Elizabeth, on the contrary, was dark
had Chinese eyes in a pale face; an Oriental mystery; was gentle, considerate, still.
As a child, she had had a perfect sense of humour
but now at seventeen, why, Clarissa could not in the least understand
she had become very serious
like a hyacinth, sheathed in glossy green, with buds just tinted, a hyacinth which has had no sun.
She stood quite still and looked at her mother
but the door was ajar, and outside the door was Miss Kilman, as Clarissa knew
Miss Kilman in her mackintosh, listening to whatever they said.
Yes, Miss Kilman stood on the landing, and wore a mackintosh
but had her reasons.
First, it was cheap
second, she was over forty
and did not, after all, dress to please.
She was poor, moreover; degradingly poor.
Otherwise she would not be taking jobs from people like the Dalloways; from rich people, who liked to be kind.
Mr. Dalloway, to do him justice, had been kind.
But Mrs. Dalloway had not.
She had been merely condescending.
She came from the most worthless of all classes
the rich, with a smattering of culture.
They had expensive things everywhere; pictures, carpets, lots of servants.
She considered that she had a perfect right to anything that the Dalloways did for her.
She had been cheated.
Yes, the word was no exaggeration, for surely a girl has a right to some kind of happiness?
And she had never been happy
what with being so clumsy and so poor.
And then, just as she might have had a chance at Miss Dolby's school, the war came; and she had never been able to tell lies.
Miss Dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the Germans.
She had had to go.
It was true that the family was of German origin
spelt the name Kiehlman in the eighteenth century
but her brother had been killed.
They turned her out because she would not pretend that the Germans were all villains
when she had German friends, when the only happy days of her life had been spent in Germany!
And after all, she could read history.
She had had to take whatever she could get.
Mr. Dalloway had come across her working for the Friends.
He had allowed her and that was really generous of him to teach his daughter history.
Also she did a little Extension lecturing and so on.
Then Our Lord had come to her
and here she always bowed her head .
She had seen the light two years and three months ago.
Now she did not envy women like Clarissa Dalloway; she pitied them.
She pitied and despised them from the bottom of her heart, as she stood on the soft carpet, looking at the old engraving of a little girl with a muff.
With all this luxury going on, what hope was there for a better state of things?
Instead of lying on a sofa
My mother is resting, Elizabeth had said
she should have been in a factory; behind a counter
Mrs. Dalloway and all the other fine ladies!
Bitter and burning, Miss Kilman had turned into a church two years three months ago.
She had heard the Rev. Edward Whittaker preach
the boys sing
had seen the solemn lights descend, and whether it was the music, or the voices
she herself when alone in the evening found comfort in a violin;
but the sound was excruciating;
she had no ear
the hot and turbulent feelings which boiled and surged in her had been assuaged as she sat there, and she had wept copiously, and gone to call on Mr. Whittaker at his private house in Kensington.
It was the hand of God, he said.
The Lord had shown her the way.
So now, whenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her, this hatred of Mrs. Dalloway, this grudge against the world, she thought of God.
She thought of Mr. Whittaker.
Rage was succeeded by calm.
A sweet savour filled her veins, her lips parted, and, standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh, she looked with steady and sinister serenity at Mrs. Dalloway, who came out with her daughter.
Elizabeth said she had forgotten her gloves.
That was because Miss Kilman and her mother hated each other.
She could not bear to see them together.
She ran upstairs to find her gloves.
But Miss Kilman did not hate Mrs. Dalloway.
Turning her large gooseberry coloured eyes upon Clarissa, observing her small pink face, her delicate body, her air of freshness and fashion, Miss Kilman felt, Fool!
Simpleton!
You who have known neither sorrow nor pleasure; who have trifled your life away!
And there rose in her an overmastering desire to overcome her; to unmask her.
If she could have felled her it would have eased her.
But it was not the body
it was the soul and its mockery that she wished to subdue
make feel her mastery.
If only she could make her weep
could ruin her
humiliate her
bring her to her knees crying
You are right!
But this was God's will, not Miss Kilman's.
It was to be a religious victory.
So she glared
so she glowered.
Clarissa was really shocked.
This a Christian
this woman!
This woman had taken her daughter from her!
She in touch with invisible presences!
Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or grace, she know the meaning of life!
You are taking Elizabeth to the Stores? Mrs. Dalloway said.
Miss Kilman said she was.
They stood there.
Miss Kilman was not going to make herself agreeable.
She had always earned her living.
Her knowledge of modern history was thorough in the extreme.
She did out of her meagre income set aside so much for causes she believed in
whereas this woman did nothing
believed nothing
brought up her daughter
but here was Elizabeth, rather out of breath, the beautiful girl.
So they were going to the Stores.
Odd it was, as Miss Kilman stood there and stand she did, with the power and taciturnity of some prehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare , how, second by second, the idea of her diminished, how hatred which was for ideas, not people crumbled, how she lost her malignity, her size, became second by second merely Miss Kilman, in a mackintosh, whom Heaven knows Clarissa would have liked to help.
At this dwindling of the monster, Clarissa laughed.
Saying good bye, she laughed.
Off they went together, Miss Kilman and Elizabeth, downstairs.
With a sudden impulse, with a violent anguish, for this woman was taking her daughter from her, Clarissa leant over the bannisters and cried out, Remember the party!
Remember our party tonight!
But Elizabeth had already opened the front door
there was a van passing
she did not answer.
Love and religion! thought Clarissa, going back into the drawing room, tingling all over.
How detestable, how detestable they are!
For now that the body of Miss Kilman was not before her, it overwhelmed her the idea.
The cruelest things in the world, she thought, seeing them clumsy, hot, domineering, hypocritical, eavesdropping, jealous, infinitely cruel and unscrupulous, dressed in a mackintosh coat, on the landing; love and religion.
Had she ever tried to convert any one herself?
Did she not wish everybody merely to be themselves?
And she watched out of the window the old lady opposite climbing upstairs.
Let her climb upstairs if she wanted to
let her stop
then let her, as Clarissa had often seen her, gain her bedroom, part her curtains, and disappear again into the background.
Somehow one respected that
that old woman looking out of the window, quite unconscious that she was being watched.
There was something solemn in it but love and religion would destroy that, whatever it was, the privacy of the soul.
The odious Kilman would destroy it.
Yet it was a sight that made her want to cry.
Love destroyed too.
Everything that was fine, everything that was true went.
Take Peter Walsh now.
There was a man, charming, clever, with ideas about everything.
If you wanted to know about Pope, say, or Addison, or just to talk nonsense, what people were like, what things meant, Peter knew better than any one.
It was Peter who had helped her; Peter who had lent her books.
But look at the women he loved
he came to see her after all these years, and what did he talk about?
Himself.
Horrible passion! she thought.
Degrading passion! she thought, thinking of Kilman and her Elizabeth walking to the Army and Navy Stores.
Big Ben struck the half hour.
How extraordinary it was, strange, yes, touching, to see the old lady they had been neighbours ever so many years move away from the window, as if she were attached to that sound, that string.
Gigantic as it was, it had something to do with her.
Down, down, into the midst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn.
She was forced, so Clarissa imagined, by that sound, to move, to go
but where?
Clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and disappeared, and could still just see her white cap moving at the back of the bedroom.
She was still there moving about at the other end of the room.
Why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes?
when, thought Clarissa, that's the miracle, that's the mystery; that old lady, she meant, whom she could see going from chest of drawers to dressing table.
She could still see her.
And the supreme mystery which Kilman might say she had solved, or Peter might say he had solved, but Clarissa didn't believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving, was simply this: here was one room; there another.
Did religion solve that, or love?
Love but here the other clock, the clock which always struck two minutes after Big Ben, came shuffling in with its lap full of odds and ends, which it dumped down as if Big Ben were all very well with his majesty laying down the law, so solemn, so just, but she must remember all sorts of little things besides
Mrs. Marsham, Ellie Henderson, glasses for ices
all sorts of little things came flooding and lapping and dancing in on the wake of that solemn stroke which lay flat like a bar of gold on the sea.
Mrs. Marsham, Ellie Henderson, glasses for ices.
She must telephone now at once.
Volubly, troublously, the late clock sounded, coming in on the wake of Big Ben, with its lap full of trifles.
Beaten up, broken up by the assault of carriages, the brutality of vans, the eager advance of myriads of angular men, of flaunting women, the domes and spires of offices and hospitals, the last relics of this lap full of odds and ends seemed to break, like the spray of an exhausted wave, upon the body of Miss Kilman standing still in the street for a moment to mutter It is the flesh.
It was the flesh that she must control.
Clarissa Dalloway had insulted her.
That she expected.
But she had not triumphed; she had not mastered the flesh.
Ugly, clumsy, Clarissa Dalloway had laughed at her for being that
and had revived the fleshly desires, for she minded looking as she did beside Clarissa.
Nor could she talk as she did.
But why wish to resemble her?
She despised Mrs. Dalloway from the bottom of her heart.
She was not serious.
She was not good.
Her life was a tissue of vanity and deceit.
Yet Doris Kilman had been overcome.
She had, as a matter of fact, very nearly burst into tears when Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her.
She prayed to God.
She could not help being ugly;
she could not afford to buy pretty clothes.
Clarissa Dalloway had laughed
but she would concentrate her mind upon something else until she had reached the pillar box.
At any rate she had got Elizabeth.
But she would think of something else;
she would think of Russia;
until she reached the pillar box.
How nice it must be, she said, in the country, struggling, as Mr. Whittaker had told her, with that violent grudge against the world which had scorned her, sneered at her, cast her off, beginning with this indignity
the infliction of her unlovable body which people could not bear to see.
Do her hair as she might, her forehead remained like an egg, bald, white.
No clothes suited her.
She might buy anything.
And for a woman, of course, that meant never meeting the opposite sex.
Never would she come first with any one.
Sometimes lately it had seemed to her that, except for Elizabeth, her food was all that she lived for
her comforts; her dinner, her tea; her hot water bottle at night.
But one must fight; vanquish; have faith in God.
Mr. Whittaker had said she was there for a purpose.
But no one knew the agony!
He said, pointing to the crucifix, that God knew.
But why should she have to suffer when other women, like Clarissa Dalloway, escaped?
Knowledge comes through suffering, said Mr. Whittaker.
She had passed the pillar box
The flesh, she muttered.
What department did she want? Elizabeth interrupted her.
Petticoats, she said abruptly, and stalked straight on to the lift.
Up they went.
Elizabeth guided her this way and that; guided her in her abstraction as if she had been a great child, an unwieldy battleship.
There were the petticoats
brown, decorous, striped, frivolous, solid, flimsy; and she chose, in her abstraction, portentously, and the girl serving thought her mad.
Elizabeth rather wondered, as they did up the parcel, what Miss Kilman was thinking.
They must have their tea, said Miss Kilman, rousing, collecting herself.
They had their tea.
Elizabeth rather wondered whether Miss Kilman could be hungry.
It was her way of eating, eating with intensity, then looking, again and again, at a plate of sugared cakes on the table next them; then, when a lady and a child sat down and the child took the cake, could Miss Kilman really mind it?
Yes, Miss Kilman did mind it.
She had wanted that cake the pink one.
The pleasure of eating was almost the only pure pleasure left her, and then to be baffled even in that!
When people are happy, she had told Elizabeth,
After all, there were people who did not think the English invariably right.
There were books.
There were meetings.
There were other points of view.
a most extraordinary looking old man
Then Miss Kilman took her to some church in Kensington and they had tea with a clergyman.
She had lent her books.
Law, medicine, politics, all professions are open to women of your generation, said Miss Kilman.
But for herself, her career was absolutely ruined and was it her fault?
Good gracious, said Elizabeth, no.
And her mother would come calling to say that a hamper had come from Bourton and would Miss Kilman like some flowers?
To Miss Kilman she was always very, very nice
but Miss Kilman squashed the flowers all in a bunch, and hadn't any small talk, and what interested Miss Kilman bored her mother, and Miss Kilman and she were terrible together;
and Miss Kilman swelled and looked very plain.
But then Miss Kilman was frightfully clever.
Elizabeth had never thought about the poor.
They lived with everything they wanted
her mother had breakfast in bed every day
Lucy carried it up
and she liked old women because they were Duchesses, and being descended from some Lord.
But Miss Kilman said one of those Tuesday mornings when the lesson was over , My grandfather kept an oil and colour shop in Kensington.
Miss Kilman made one feel so small.
Miss Kilman took another cup of tea.
Elizabeth, with her oriental bearing, her inscrutable mystery, sat perfectly upright; no, she did not want anything more.
She looked for her gloves her white gloves.
They were under the table.
Ah, but she must not go!
Miss Kilman could not let her go!
this youth, that was so beautiful
this girl, whom she genuinely loved!
Her large hand opened and shut on the table.
But perhaps it was a little flat somehow, Elizabeth felt.
And really she would like to go.
But said Miss Kilman, I've not quite finished yet.
Of course, then, Elizabeth would wait.
But it was rather stuffy in here.
Are you going to the party to night? Miss Kilman said.
Elizabeth supposed she was going; her mother wanted her to go.
She must not let parties absorb her, Miss Kilman said, fingering the last two inches of a chocolate eclair.
She did not much like parties, Elizabeth said.
Miss Kilman opened her mouth, slightly projected her chin, and swallowed down the last inches of the chocolate eclair
then wiped her fingers, and washed the tea round in her cup.
She was about to split asunder, she felt.
The agony was so terrific.
If she could grasp her, if she could clasp her, if she could make her hers absolutely and forever and then die
that was all she wanted.
But to sit here, unable to think of anything to say
to see Elizabeth turning against her
to be felt repulsive even by her
it was too much
she could not stand it.
The thick fingers curled inwards.
I never go to parties, said Miss Kilman, just to keep Elizabeth from going.
People don't ask me to parties
and she knew as she said it that it was this egotism that was her undoing;
Mr. Whittaker had warned her
but she could not help it.
She had suffered so horribly.
Why should they ask me? she said.
I'm plain, I'm unhappy.
She knew it was idiotic.
But it was all those people passing people with parcels who despised her, who made her say it.
However, she was Doris Kilman.
She had her degree.
She was a woman who had made her way in the world.
Her knowledge of modern history was more than respectable.
I don't pity myself, she said.
I pity
she meant to say your mother
but no, she could not, not to Elizabeth.
I pity other people, she said, more.
Like some dumb creature who has been brought up to a gate for an unknown purpose, and stands there longing to gallop away, Elizabeth Dalloway sat silent.
Was Miss Kilman going to say anything more?
Don't quite forget me, said Doris Kilman
her voice quivered.
Right away to the end of the field the dumb creature galloped in terror.
The great hand opened and shut.
Elizabeth turned her head.
The waitress came.
One had to pay at the desk, Elizabeth said, and went off
drawing out, so Miss Kilman felt, the very entrails in her body, stretching them as she crossed the room, and then, with a final twist, bowing her head very politely, she went.
She had gone.
Miss Kilman sat at the marble table among the eclairs, stricken once, twice, thrice by shocks of suffering.
Mrs. Dalloway had triumphed.
Elizabeth had gone.
Beauty had gone
youth had gone.
So she sat.
She got up
blundered off among the little tables, rocking slightly from side to side, and somebody came after her with her petticoat, and she lost her way, and was hemmed in by trunks specially prepared for taking to India
next got among the accouchement sets, and baby linen
through all the commodities of the world, perishable and permanent, hams, drugs, flowers, stationery, variously smelling, now sweet, now sour she lurched
saw herself thus lurching with her hat askew, very red in the face, full length in a looking glass; and at last came out into the street.
The tower of Westminster Cathedral rose in front of her, the habitation of God.
In the midst of the traffic, there was the habitation of God.
Doggedly she set off with her parcel to that other sanctuary, the Abbey, where, raising her hands in a tent before her face, she sat beside those driven into shelter too
the variously assorted worshippers, now divested of social rank, almost of sex, as they raised their hands before their faces
but once they removed them, instantly reverent, middle class, English men and women, some of them desirous of seeing the wax works.
But Miss Kilman held her tent before her face.
Now she was deserted; now rejoined.
New worshippers came in from the street to replace the strollers, and still, as people gazed round and shuffled past the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, still she barred her eyes with her fingers and tried in this double darkness, for the light in the Abbey was bodiless, to aspire above the vanities, the desires, the commodities, to rid herself both of hatred and of love.
Her hands twitched.
She seemed to struggle.
Yet to others God was accessible and the path to Him smooth.
Mr. Fletcher, retired, of the Treasury, Mrs. Gorham, widow of the famous K. C. , approached Him simply, and having done their praying, leant back, enjoyed the music the organ pealed sweetly , and saw Miss Kilman at the end of the row, praying, praying, and, being still on the threshold of their underworld, thought of her sympathetically as a soul haunting the same territory
a soul cut out of immaterial substance; not a woman, a soul.
But Mr. Fletcher had to go.
He had to pass her, and being himself neat as a new pin, could not help being a little distressed by the poor lady's disorder
her hair down
her parcel on the floor.
She did not at once let him pass.
But, as he stood gazing about him, at the white marbles, grey window panes, and accumulated treasures for he was extremely proud of the Abbey , her largeness, robustness, and power as she sat there shifting her knees from time to time it was so rough the approach to her God so tough her desires impressed him, as they had impressed Mrs. Dalloway
she could not get the thought of her out of her mind that afternoon
the Rev. Edward Whittaker, and Elizabeth too.
And Elizabeth waited in Victoria Street for an omnibus.
It was so nice to be out of doors.
She thought perhaps she need not go home just yet.
It was so nice to be out in the air.
So she would get on to an omnibus.
And already, even as she stood there, in her very well cut clothes, it was beginning....
People were beginning to compare her to poplar trees, early dawn, hyacinths, fawns, running water, and garden lilies
and it made her life a burden to her, for she so much preferred being left alone to do what she liked in the country, but they would compare her to lilies, and she had to go to parties, and London was so dreary compared with being alone in the country with her father and the dogs.
Buses swooped, settled, were off
garish caravans, glistening with red and yellow varnish.
But which should she get on to?
She had no preferences.
Of course, she would not push her way.
She inclined to be passive.
It was expression she needed
but her eyes were fine
Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders and holding herself so straight, she was always charming to look at
and lately, in the evening especially, when she was interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately, very serene.
What could she be thinking?
Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored.
For it was beginning.
Her mother could see that the compliments were beginning.
That she did not care more about it for instance for her clothes sometimes worried Clarissa
but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave her a charm.
And now there was this odd friendship with Miss Kilman.
Well, thought Clarissa about three o'clock in the morning, reading Baron Marbot for she could not sleep, it proves she has a heart.
Suddenly Elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded the omnibus, in front of everybody.
She took a seat on top.
The impetuous creature a pirate started forward, sprang away; she had to hold the rail to steady herself, for a pirate it was, reckless, unscrupulous, bearing down ruthlessly, circumventing dangerously, boldly snatching a passenger, or ignoring a passenger, squeezing eel like and arrogant in between, and then rushing insolently all sails spread up Whitehall.
And did Elizabeth give one thought to poor Miss Kilman who loved her without jealousy, to whom she had been a fawn in the open, a moon in a glade?
She was delighted to be free.
The fresh air was so delicious.
It had been so stuffy in the Army and Navy Stores.
And now it was like riding, to be rushing up Whitehall; and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn coloured coat responded freely like a rider
like the figure head of a ship, for the breeze slightly disarrayed her; the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood; and her fine eyes, having no eyes to meet, gazed ahead, blank, bright, with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture.
It was always talking about her own sufferings that made Miss Kilman so difficult.
And was she right?
If it was being on committees and giving up hours and hours every day she hardly ever saw him in London that helped the poor, her father did that, goodness knows
if that was what Miss Kilman meant about being a Christian
but it was so difficult to say.
Oh, she would like to go a little further.
Another penny was it to the Strand?
Here was another penny then.
She would go up the Strand.
She liked people who were ill.
And every profession is open to the women of your generation, said Miss Kilman.
So she might be a doctor.
She might be a farmer.
Animals are often ill.
She might own a thousand acres and have people under her.
She would go and see them in their cottages.
This was Somerset House.
One might be a very good farmer
and that, strangely enough though Miss Kilman had her share in it, was almost entirely due to Somerset House.
It looked so splendid, so serious, that great grey building.
And she liked the feeling of people working.
She liked those churches
like shapes of grey paper, breasting the stream of the Strand.
It was quite different here from Westminster, she thought, getting off at Chancery Lane.
It was so serious; it was so busy.
In short, she would like to have a profession.
She would become a doctor, a farmer, possibly go into Parliament, if she found it necessary, all because of the Strand.
The feet of those people busy about their activities, hands putting stone to stone, minds eternally occupied not with trivial chatterings comparing women to poplars which was rather exciting, of course, but very silly , but with thoughts of ships, of business, of law, of administration, and with it all so stately she was in the Temple , gay there was the river , pious there was the Church , made her quite determined, whatever her mother might say, to become either a farmer or a doctor.
But she was, of course, rather lazy.
And it was much better to say nothing about it.
It seemed so silly.
It was the sort of thing that did sometimes happen, when one was alone
buildings without architects' names, crowds of people coming back from the city having more power than single clergymen in Kensington, than any of the books Miss Kilman had lent her, to stimulate what lay slumbrous, clumsy, and shy on the mind's sandy floor to break surface, as a child suddenly stretches its arms
it was just that, perhaps, a sigh, a stretch of the arms, an impulse, a revelation, which has its effects for ever
and then down again it went to the sandy floor.
She must go home.
She must dress for dinner.
But what was the time?
where was a clock?
She looked up Fleet Street.
She walked just a little way towards St. Paul's, shyly, like some one penetrating on tiptoe, exploring a strange house by night with a candle, on edge lest the owner should suddenly fling wide his bedroom door and ask her business, nor did she dare wander off into queer alleys, tempting bye streets, any more than in a strange house open doors which might be bedroom doors, or sitting room doors, or lead straight to the larder.
For no Dalloways came down the Strand daily; she was a pioneer, a stray, venturing, trusting.
In many ways, her mother felt, she was extremely immature, like a child still, attached to dolls, to old slippers; a perfect baby; and that was charming.
But then, of course, there was in the Dalloway family the tradition of public service.
Abbesses, principals, head mistresses, dignitaries, in the republic of women without being brilliant, any of them, they were that.
She penetrated a little further in the direction of St. Paul's.
She liked the geniality, sisterhood, motherhood, brotherhood of this uproar.
It seemed to her good.
The noise was tremendous
and suddenly there were trumpets the unemployed blaring, rattling about in the uproar
military music; as if people were marching
yet had they been dying
had some woman breathed her last and whoever was watching, opening the window of the room where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity, looked down on Fleet Street, that uproar, that military music would have come triumphing up to him, consolatory, indifferent.
It was not conscious.
There was no recognition in it of one fortune, or fate, and for that very reason even to those dazed with watching for the last shivers of consciousness on the faces of the dying, consoling.
Forgetfulness in people might wound, their ingratitude corrode, but this voice, pouring endlessly, year in year out, would take whatever it might be; this vow; this van; this life; this procession, would wrap them all about and carry them on
as in the rough stream of a glacier the ice holds a splinter of bone, a blue petal, some oak trees, and rolls them on.
But it was later than she thought.
Her mother would not like her to be wandering off alone like this.
She turned back down the Strand.
A puff of wind in spite of the heat, there was quite a wind blew a thin black veil over the sun and over the Strand.
The faces faded
the omnibuses suddenly lost their glow.
For although the clouds were of mountainous white so that one could fancy hacking hard chips off with a hatchet, with broad golden slopes, lawns of celestial pleasure gardens, on their flanks, and had all the appearance of settled habitations assembled for the conference of gods above the world, there was a perpetual movement among them.
Signs were interchanged, when, as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already, now a summit dwindled, now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its station inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the procession to fresh anchorage.
Fixed though they seemed at their posts, at rest in perfect unanimity, nothing could be fresher, freer, more sensitive superficially than the snow white or gold kindled surface; to change, to go, to dismantle the solemn assemblage was immediately possible
in spite of the grave fixity, the accumulated robustness and solidity, now they struck light to the earth, now darkness.
Calmly and competently, Elizabeth Dalloway mounted the Westminster omnibus.
Going and coming, beckoning, signalling, so the light and shadow which now made the wall grey, now the bananas bright yellow, now made the Strand grey, now made the omnibuses bright yellow, seemed to Septimus Warren Smith lying on the sofa in the sitting room; watching the watery gold glow and fade with the astonishing sensibility of some live creature on the roses, on the wall paper.
Outside the trees dragged their leaves like nets through the depths of the air; the sound of water was in the room and through the waves came the voices of birds singing.
Every power poured its treasures on his head, and his hand lay there on the back of the sofa, as he had seen his hand lie when he was bathing, floating, on the top of the waves, while far away on shore he heard dogs barking and barking far away.
Fear no more, says the heart in the body; fear no more.
He was not afraid.
At every moment Nature signified by some laughing hint like that gold spot which went round the wall there, there, there her determination to show, by brandishing her plumes, shaking her tresses, flinging her mantle this way and that, beautifully, always beautifully, and standing close up to breathe through her hollowed hands Shakespeare's words, her meaning.
Rezia, sitting at the table twisting a hat in her hands, watched him
saw him smiling.
He was happy then.
But she could not bear to see him smiling.
It was not marriage
it was not being one's husband to look strange like that, always to be starting, laughing, sitting hour after hour silent, or clutching her and telling her to write.
The table drawer was full of those writings
about war; about Shakespeare; about great discoveries; how there is no death.
Lately he had become excited suddenly for no reason and both Dr. Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him , and waved his hands and cried out that he knew the truth!
He knew everything!
That man, his friend who was killed, Evans, had come, he said.
He was singing behind the screen.
She wrote it down just as he spoke it.
Some things were very beautiful
others sheer nonsense.
And he was always stopping in the middle, changing his mind
wanting to add something
hearing something new
listening with his hand up.
But she heard nothing.
And once they found the girl who did the room reading one of these papers in fits of laughter.
It was a dreadful pity.
For that made Septimus cry out about human cruelty how they tear each other to pieces.
The fallen, he said, they tear to pieces.
Holmes is on us, he would say, and he would invent stories about Holmes
Holmes eating porridge
Holmes reading Shakespeare
making himself roar with laughter or rage, for Dr. Holmes seemed to stand for something horrible to him.
Human nature, he called him.
Then there were the visions.
He was drowned, he used to say, and lying on a cliff with the gulls screaming over him.
He would look over the edge of the sofa down into the sea.
Or he was hearing music.
Really it was only a barrel organ or some man crying in the street.
But Lovely! he used to cry
and the tears would run down his cheeks, which was to her the most dreadful thing of all, to see a man like Septimus, who had fought, who was brave, crying.
And he would lie listening until suddenly he would cry that he was falling down, down into the flames!
Actually she would look for flames, it was so vivid.
But there was nothing.
They were alone in the room.
It was a dream, she would tell him and so quiet him at last, but sometimes she was frightened too.
She sighed as she sat sewing.
Her sigh was tender and enchanting
like the wind outside a wood in the evening.
Now she put down her scissors
now she turned to take something from the table.
A little stir, a little crinkling, a little tapping built up something on the table there, where she sat sewing.
Through his eyelashes he could see her blurred outline; her little black body; her face and hands
her turning movements at the table, as she took up a reel, or looked she was apt to lose things for her silk.
She was making a hat for Mrs. Filmer's married daughter, whose name was he had forgotten her name.
What is the name of Mrs. Filmer's married daughter? he asked.
Mrs. Peters, said Rezia.
She was afraid it was too small, she said, holding it before her.
Mrs. Peters was a big woman; but she did not like her.
It was only because Mrs. Filmer had been so good to them.
She gave me grapes this morning, she said
that Rezia wanted to do something to show that they were grateful.
She had come into the room the other evening and found Mrs. Peters, who thought they were out, playing the gramophone.
Was it true? he asked.
She was playing the gramophone?
Yes; she had told him about it at the time; she had found Mrs. Peters playing the gramophone.
He began, very cautiously, to open his eyes, to see whether a gramophone was really there.
But real things
real things were too exciting.
He must be cautious.
He would not go mad.
First he looked at the fashion papers on the lower shelf, then, gradually at the gramophone with the green trumpet.
Nothing could be more exact.
And so, gathering courage, he looked at the sideboard; the plate of bananas; the engraving of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort; at the mantelpiece, with the jar of roses.
None of these things moved.
All were still
all were real.
She is a woman with a spiteful tongue, said Rezia.
What does Mr. Peters do? Septimus asked.
Ah, said Rezia, trying to remember.
She thought Mrs. Filmer had said that he travelled for some company.
Just now he is in Hull, she said.
Just now!
She said that with her Italian accent.
She said that herself.
He shaded his eyes so that he might see only a little of her face at a time, first the chin, then the nose, then the forehead, in case it were deformed, or had some terrible mark on it.
But no, there she was, perfectly natural, sewing, with the pursed lips that women have, the set, the melancholy expression, when sewing.
looking a second time, a third time at her face, her hands
for what was frightening or disgusting in her as she sat there in broad daylight, sewing?
Mrs. Peters had a spiteful tongue.
Mr. Peters was in Hull.
Why then rage and prophesy?
Why fly scourged and outcast?
Why be made to tremble and sob by the clouds?
Why seek truths and deliver messages when Rezia sat sticking pins into the front of her dress, and Mr. Peters was in Hull?
Miracles, revelations, agonies, loneliness, falling through the sea, down, down into the flames, all were burnt out, for he had a sense, as he watched Rezia trimming the straw hat for Mrs. Peters, of a coverlet of flowers.
It's too small for Mrs. Peters, said Septimus.
For the first time for days he was speaking as he used to do!
Of course it was absurdly small, she said.
But Mrs. Peters had chosen it.
He took it out of her hands.
He said it was an organ grinder's monkey's hat.
How it rejoiced her that!
Not for weeks had they laughed like this together, poking fun privately like married people.
What she meant was that if Mrs. Filmer had come in, or Mrs. Peters or anybody they would not have understood what she and Septimus were laughing at.
There, she said, pinning a rose to one side of the hat.
Never had she felt so happy!
Never in her life!
But that was still more ridiculous, Septimus said.
Now the poor woman looked like a pig at a fair.
Nobody ever made her laugh as Septimus did.
What had she got in her work box?
She had ribbons and beads, tassels, artificial flowers.
She tumbled them out on the table.
He began putting odd colours together
for though he had no fingers, could not even do up a parcel, he had a wonderful eye, and often he was right, sometimes absurd, of course, but sometimes wonderfully right.
She shall have a beautiful hat! he murmured, taking up this and that, Rezia kneeling by his side, looking over his shoulder.
Now it was finished
that is to say the design; she must stitch it together.
But she must be very, very careful, he said, to keep it just as he had made it.
So she sewed.
When she sewed, he thought, she made a sound like a kettle on the hob
bubbling, murmuring, always busy, her strong little pointed fingers pinching and poking
her needle flashing straight.
The sun might go in and out, on the tassels, on the wall paper, but he would wait, he thought, stretching out his feet, looking at his ringed sock at the end of the sofa; he would wait in this warm place, this pocket of still air, which one comes on at the edge of a wood sometimes in the evening, when, because of a fall in the ground, or some arrangement of the trees one must be scientific above all, scientific , warmth lingers, and the air buffets the cheek like the wing of a bird.
There it is, said Rezia, twirling Mrs. Peters' hat on the tips of her fingers.
That'll do for the moment.
Later...
her sentence bubbled away drip, drip, drip, like a contented tap left running.
It was wonderful.
Never had he done anything which made him feel so proud.
It was so real, it was so substantial, Mrs. Peters' hat.
Just look at it, he said.
Yes, it would always make her happy to see that hat.
He had become himself then, he had laughed then.
They had been alone together.
Always she would like that hat.
He told her to try it on.
But I must look so queer! she cried, running over to the glass
and looking first this side then that.
Then she snatched it off again, for there was a tap at the door.
Could it be Sir William Bradshaw?
Had he sent already?
it was only the small girl with the evening paper.
What always happened, then happened
what happened every night of their lives.
The small girl sucked her thumb at the door; Rezia went down on her knees; Rezia cooed and kissed; Rezia got a bag of sweets out of the table drawer.
For so it always happened.
First one thing, then another.
So she built it up, first one thing and then another.
Dancing, skipping, round and round the room they went.
He took the paper.
Surrey was all out, he read.
There was a heat wave.
Rezia repeated: Surrey was all out.
There was a heat wave, making it part of the game she was playing with Mrs. Filmer's grandchild, both of them laughing, chattering at the same time, at their game.
He was very tired.
He was very happy.
He would sleep.
He shut his eyes.
But directly he saw nothing the sounds of the game became fainter and stranger and sounded like the cries of people seeking and not finding, and passing further and further away.
They had lost him!
He started up in terror.
What did he see?
The plate of bananas on the sideboard.
Nobody was there
Rezia had taken the child to its mother.
It was bedtime
That was it: to be alone forever.
That was the doom pronounced in Milan when he came into the room and saw them cutting out buckram shapes with their scissors
to be alone forever.
He was alone with the sideboard and the bananas.
He was alone, exposed on this bleak eminence, stretched out
but not on a hill top; not on a crag; on Mrs. Filmer's sitting room sofa.
As for the visions, the faces, the voices of the dead, where were they?
There was a screen in front of him, with black bulrushes and blue swallows.
Where he had once seen mountains, where he had seen faces, where he had seen beauty, there was a screen.
Evans! he cried.
There was no answer.
A mouse had squeaked, or a curtain rustled.
Those were the voices of the dead.
The screen, the coalscuttle, the sideboard remained to him.
Let him then face the screen, the coal scuttle and the sideboard ...
but Rezia burst into the room chattering.
Some letter had come.
Everybody's plans were changed.
Mrs. Filmer would not be able to go to Brighton after all.
There was no time to let Mrs. Williams know, and really Rezia thought it very, very annoying, when she caught sight of the hat and thought...
perhaps...
she...
might just make a little....
Her voice died out in contented melody.
Ah, damn! she cried
it was a joke of theirs, her swearing
the needle had broken.
Hat, child, Brighton, needle.
She built it up
first one thing, then another, she built it up, sewing.
She wanted him to say whether by moving the rose she had improved the hat.
She sat on the end of the sofa.
They were perfectly happy now, she said, suddenly, putting the hat down.
For she could say anything to him now.
She could say whatever came into her head.
That was almost the first thing she had felt about him, that night in the cafe when he had come in with his English friends.
He had come in, rather shyly, looking round him, and his hat had fallen when he hung it up.
That she could remember.
She knew he was English, though not one of the large Englishmen her sister admired, for he was always thin
but he had a beautiful fresh colour
and with his big nose, his bright eyes, his way of sitting a little hunched made her think, she had often told him, of a young hawk, that first evening she saw him, when they were playing dominoes, and he had come in of a young hawk
but with her he was always very gentle.
She had never seen him wild or drunk, only suffering sometimes through this terrible war, but even so, when she came in, he would put it all away.
Anything, anything in the whole world, any little bother with her work, anything that struck her to say she would tell him, and he understood at once.
Her own family even were not the same.
Being older than she was and being so clever
how serious he was, wanting her to read Shakespeare before she could even read a child's story in English!
being so much more experienced, he could help her.
And she too could help him.
But this hat now.
And then it was getting late Sir William Bradshaw.
She held her hands to her head, waiting for him to say did he like the hat or not, and as she sat there, waiting, looking down, he could feel her mind, like a bird, falling from branch to branch, and always alighting, quite rightly
he could follow her mind, as she sat there in one of those loose lax poses that came to her naturally and, if he should say anything, at once she smiled, like a bird alighting with all its claws firm upon the bough.
But he remembered Bradshaw said, The people we are most fond of are not good for us when we are ill.
Bradshaw said, he must be taught to rest.
Bradshaw said they must be separated.
Must, must, why must?
What power had Bradshaw over him?
What right has Bradshaw to say must' to me? he demanded.
It is because you talked of killing yourself, said Rezia.
Mercifully, she could now say anything to Septimus.
So he was in their power!
Holmes and Bradshaw were on him!
The brute with the red nostrils was snuffing into every secret place!
Must it could say!
Where were his papers?
the things he had written?
She brought him his papers, the things he had written, things she had written for him.
She tumbled them out on to the sofa.
They looked at them together.
on their backs; circles traced round shillings and sixpences
the suns and stars; zigzagging precipices with mountaineers ascending roped together, exactly like knives and forks
sea pieces with little faces laughing out of what might perhaps be waves
the map of the world.
Burn them! he cried.
Now for his writings; how the dead sing behind rhododendron bushes; odes to Time; conversations with Shakespeare; Evans, Evans, Evans his messages from the dead; do not cut down trees; tell the Prime Minister.
Universal love: the meaning of the world.
But Rezia laid her hands on them.
Some were very beautiful, she thought.
She would tie them up for she had no envelope with a piece of silk.
Even if they took him, she said, she would go with him.
They could not separate them against their wills, she said.
Shuffling the edges straight, she did up the papers, and tied the parcel almost without looking, sitting beside him, he thought, as if all her petals were about her.
She was a flowering tree; and through her branches looked out the face of a lawgiver, who had reached a sanctuary where she feared no one; not Holmes; not Bradshaw; a miracle, a triumph, the last and greatest.
Staggering he saw her mount the appalling staircase, laden with Holmes and Bradshaw, men who never weighed less than eleven stone six, who sent their wives to Court, men who made ten thousand a year and talked of proportion
who different in their verdicts for Holmes said one thing, Bradshaw another , yet judges they were
who mixed the vision and the sideboard; saw nothing clear, yet ruled, yet inflicted.
Over them she triumphed.
The papers were tied up.
No one should get at them.
She would put them away.
And, she said, nothing should separate them.
She sat down beside him and called him by the name of that hawk or crow which being malicious and a great destroyer of crops was precisely like him.
No one could separate them, she said.
Then she got up to go into the bedroom to pack their things, but hearing voices downstairs and thinking that Dr. Holmes had perhaps called, ran down to prevent him coming up.
Septimus could hear her talking to Holmes on the staircase.
My dear lady, I have come as a friend,
Holmes was saying.
I will not allow you to see my husband, she said.
He could see her, like a little hen, with her wings spread barring his passage.
But Holmes persevered.
My dear lady, allow me...
putting her aside Holmes was a powerfully built man .
Holmes said,
Holmes was coming upstairs.
Holmes would burst open the door.
Holmes would say
Holmes would get him.
But no; not Holmes; not Bradshaw.
Getting up rather unsteadily, hopping indeed from foot to foot, he considered Mrs.
Filmer's nice clean bread knife with Bread carved on the handle.
The gas fire?
But it was too late now.
Holmes was coming.
Razors he might have got, but Rezia, who always did that sort of thing, had packed them.
There remained only the window, the large Bloomsbury lodging house window, the tiresome, the troublesome, and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out.
It was their idea of tragedy, not his or Rezia's for she was with him .
Holmes and Bradshaw like that sort of thing.
He sat on the sill.
But he would wait till the very last moment.
He did not want to die.
Life was good.
The sun hot.
Holmes was at the door.
I'll give it you!
he cried
Rezia ran to the window, she saw
she understood.
Dr. Holmes and Mrs. Filmer collided with each other.
Mrs. Filmer flapped her apron and made her hide her eyes in the bedroom.
There was a great deal of running up and down stairs.
Dr. Holmes came in
white as a sheet, shaking all over, with a glass in his hand.
She must be brave and drink something, he said
What was it?
Something sweet
for her husband was horribly mangled, would not recover consciousness, she must not see him, must be spared as much as possible, would have the inquest to go through, poor young woman.
Who could have foretold it?
A sudden impulse, no one was in the least to blame he told Mrs. Filmer .
And why the devil he did it, Dr. Holmes could not conceive.
It seemed to her as she drank the sweet stuff that she was opening long windows, stepping out into some garden.
The clock was striking one, two, three
how sensible the sound was
compared with all this thumping and whispering; like Septimus himself.
She was falling asleep.
But the clock went on striking, four, five, six and Mrs. Filmer waving her apron
they wouldn't bring the body in here, would they?
seemed part of that garden; or a flag.
She had once seen a flag slowly rippling out from a mast when she stayed with her aunt at Venice.
Men killed in battle were thus saluted, and Septimus had been through the War.
Of her memories, most were happy.
She put on her hat, and ran through cornfields where could it have been?
on to some hill, somewhere near the sea, for there were ships, gulls, butterflies; they sat on a cliff.
In London too, there they sat
But Mrs. Filmer pooh poohed.
Oh no, oh no!
They were carrying him away now.
Ought she not to be told?
Married people ought to be together, Mrs. Filmer thought.
But they must do as the doctor said.
Let her sleep,
said Dr. Holmes
So that was Dr. Holmes.
One of the triumphs of civilisation, Peter Walsh thought.
It is one of the triumphs of civilisation, as the light high bell of the ambulance sounded.
Swiftly, cleanly the ambulance sped to the hospital, having picked up instantly, humanely, some poor devil; some one hit on the head, struck down by disease, knocked over perhaps a minute or so ago at one of these crossings, as might happen to oneself.
That was civilisation.
It struck him coming back from the East the efficiency, the organisation, the communal spirit of London.
Every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let the ambulance pass.
Perhaps it was morbid; or was it not touching rather, the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim inside busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it passed of some wife
or presumably how easily it might have been them there, stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse....
Ah, but thinking became morbid, sentimental, directly one began conjuring up doctors, dead bodies
a little glow of pleasure, a sort of lust too over the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of thing any more fatal to art, fatal to friendship.
True.
And yet, thought Peter Walsh, as the ambulance turned the corner though the light high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther as it crossed the Tottenham Court Road, chiming constantly, it is the privilege of loneliness; in privacy one may do as one chooses.
One might weep if no one saw.
It had been his undoing this susceptibility in Anglo Indian society; not weeping at the right time, or laughing either.
I have that in me, he thought standing by the pillar box, which could now dissolve in tears.
Why, Heaven knows.
Beauty of some sort probably, and the weight of the day, which beginning with that visit to Clarissa had exhausted him with its heat, its intensity, and the drip, drip, of one impression after another down into that cellar where they stood, deep, dark, and no one would ever know.
Partly for that reason, its secrecy, complete and inviolable, he had found life like an unknown garden, full of turns and corners, surprising, yes
really it took one's breath away, these moments; there coming to him by the pillar box opposite the British Museum one of them, a moment, in which things came together; this ambulance; and life and death.
It was as if he were sucked up to some very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him, like a white shell sprinkled beach, left bare.
It had been his undoing in Anglo Indian society this susceptibility.
Clarissa once, going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere, Clarissa superficially at least, so easily moved, now in despair, now in the best of spirits, all aquiver in those days and such good company, spotting queer little scenes, names, people from the top of a bus, for they used to explore London and bring back bags full of treasures from the Caledonian market Clarissa had a theory in those days they had heaps of theories, always theories, as young people have.
It was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction; not knowing people; not being known.
For how could they know each other?
You met every day; then not for six months, or years.
It was unsatisfactory, they agreed, how little one knew people.
But she said, sitting on the bus going up Shaftesbury Avenue, she felt herself everywhere; not here, here, here; and she tapped the back of the seat; but everywhere.
She waved her hand, going up Shaftesbury Avenue.
She was all that.
So that to know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who completed them; even the places.
Odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to, some woman in the street, some man behind a counter even trees, or barns.
It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed for all her scepticism , that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so momentary compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached to this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death...
perhaps
perhaps.
Looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her theory worked to this extent.
Brief, broken, often painful as their actual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions this morning, for instance, in came Elizabeth, like a long legged colt, handsome, dumb, just as he was beginning to talk to Clarissa the effect of them on his life was immeasurable.
There was a mystery about it.
You were given a sharp, acute, uncomfortable grain the actual meeting
horribly painful as often as not
yet in absence, in the most unlikely places, it would flower out, open, shed its scent, let you touch, taste, look about you, get the whole feel of it and understanding, after years of lying lost.
Thus she had come to him; on board ship; in the Himalayas; suggested by the oddest things
so Sally Seton, generous, enthusiastic goose!
thought of HIM when she saw blue hydrangeas.
She had influenced him more than any person he had ever known.
And always in this way coming before him without his wishing it, cool, lady like, critical; or ravishing, romantic, recalling some field or English harvest.
He saw her most often in the country, not in London.
One scene after another at Bourton... .
He had reached his hotel.
He crossed the hall, with its mounds of reddish chairs and sofas, its spike leaved, withered looking plants.
He got his key off the hook.
The young lady handed him some letters.
He went upstairs he saw her most often at Bourton, in the late summer, when he stayed there for a week, or fortnight even, as people did in those days.
First on top of some hill there she would stand, hands clapped to her hair, her cloak blowing out, pointing, crying to them she saw the Severn beneath.
Or in a wood, making the kettle boil very ineffective with her fingers; the smoke curtseying, blowing in their faces
her little pink face showing through
begging water from an old woman in a cottage, who came to the door to watch them go.
They walked always; the others drove.
She was bored driving, disliked all animals, except that dog.
They tramped miles along roads.
She would break off to get her bearings, pilot him back across country;
and all the time they argued, discussed poetry, discussed people, discussed politics she was a Radical then ;
never noticing a thing except when she stopped, cried out at a view or a tree, and made him look with her;
and so on again, through stubble fields, she walking ahead, with a flower for her aunt, never tired of walking for all her delicacy;
to drop down on Bourton in the dusk.
Then, after dinner, old Breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice, and they would lie sunk in arm chairs, trying not to laugh, but always breaking down and laughing, laughing laughing at nothing.
Breitkopf was supposed not to see.
And then in the morning, flirting up and down like a wagtail in front of the house....
Oh it was a letter from her!
This blue envelope; that was her hand.
And he would have to read it.
Here was another of those meetings
To read her letter needed the devil of an effort.
How heavenly it was to see him.
She must tell him that.
But it upset him.
It annoyed him.
He wished she hadn't written it.
Coming on top of his thoughts, it was like a nudge in the ribs.
Why couldn't she let him be?
After all, she had married Dalloway, and lived with him in perfect happiness all these years.
These hotels are not consoling places.
Any number of people had hung up their hats on those pegs.
Even the flies, if you thought of it, had settled on other people's noses.
As for the cleanliness which hit him in the face, it wasn't cleanliness, so much as bareness, frigidity; a thing that had to be.
Some arid matron made her rounds at dawn sniffing, peering, causing blue nosed maids to scour, for all the world as if the next visitor were a joint of meat to be served on a perfectly clean platter.
For sleep, one bed; for sitting in, one armchair
for cleaning one's teeth and shaving one's chin, one tumbler, one looking glass.
Books, letters, dressing gown, slipped about on the impersonality of the horsehair like incongruous impertinences.
And it was Clarissa's letter that made him see all this.
Heavenly to see you.
She must say so!
He folded the paper; pushed it away; nothing would induce him to read it again!
To get that letter to him by six o'clock she must have sat down and written it directly he left her; stamped it; sent somebody to the post.
It was, as people say, very like her.
She was upset by his visit.
She had felt a great deal; had for a moment, when she kissed his hand, regretted, envied him even, remembered possibly for he saw her look it something he had said
how they would change the world if she married him perhaps;
whereas, it was this;
it was middle age;
it was mediocrity;
then forced herself with her indomitable vitality to put all that aside, there being in her a thread of life which for toughness, endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her triumphantly through he had never known the like of.
Yes; but there would come a reaction directly he left the room.
She would be frightfully sorry for him
Heavenly to see you!
Peter Walsh had now unlaced his boots.
But it would not have been a success, their marriage.
The other thing, after all, came so much more naturally.
It was odd; it was true; lots of people felt it.
Peter Walsh, who had done just respectably, filled the usual posts adequately, was liked, but thought a little cranky, gave himself airs it was odd that HE should have had, especially now that his hair was grey, a contented look
a look of having reserves.
It was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly.
There was something unusual about him, or something behind him.
It might be that he was bookish never came to see you without taking up the book on the table he was now reading, with his bootlaces trailing on the floor
or that he was a gentleman, which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and in his manners of course to women.
For it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger.
But at her own risk.
That is to say, though he might be ever so easy, and indeed with his gaiety and good breeding fascinating to be with, it was only up to a point.
She said something no, no
he saw through that.
He wouldn't stand that no, no.
Then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men.
He was the best judge of cooking in India.
He was a man.
But not the sort of man one had to respect which was a mercy; not like Major Simmons, for instance; not in the least like that, Daisy thought, when, in spite of her two small children, she used to compare them.
He pulled off his boots.
He emptied his pockets.
Out came with his pocket knife a snapshot of Daisy on the verandah
Daisy all in white, with a fox terrier on her knee
very charming, very dark; the best he had ever seen of her.
It did come, after all so naturally; so much more naturally than Clarissa.
No fuss.
No bother.
No finicking and fidgeting.
All plain sailing.
And the dark, adorably pretty girl on the verandah exclaimed he could hear her .
Of course, of course she would give him everything!
she cried
running to meet him, whoever might be looking.
And she was only twenty four.
And she had two children.
Well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age.
And it came over him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly.
Suppose they did marry?
For him it would be all very well, but what about her?
Mrs. Burgess, a good sort and no chatterbox, in whom he had confided, thought this absence of his in England, ostensibly to see lawyers might serve to make Daisy reconsider, think what it meant.
It was a question of her position, Mrs. Burgess said
the social barrier
giving up her children.
She'd be a widow with a past one of these days, draggling about in the suburbs, or more likely, indiscriminate
you know, she said, what such women get like, with too much paint .
But Peter Walsh pooh poohed all that.
He didn't mean to die yet.
Anyhow she must settle for herself
judge for herself, he thought, padding about the room in his socks, smoothing out his dress shirt, for he might go to Clarissa's party, or he might go to one of the Halls, or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a man he used to know at Oxford.
And if he did retire, that's what he'd do write books.
He would go to Oxford and poke about in the Bodleian.
Vainly the dark, adorably pretty girl ran to the end of the terrace; vainly waved her hand; vainly cried she didn't care a straw what people said.
There he was, the man she thought the world of, the perfect gentleman, the fascinating, the distinguished and his age made not the least difference to her , padding about a room in an hotel in Bloomsbury, shaving, washing, continuing, as he took up cans, put down razors, to poke about in the Bodleian, and get at the truth about one or two little matters that interested him.
And he would have a chat with whoever it might be
He never knew what people thought.
It became more and more difficult for him to concentrate.
He became absorbed
he became busied with his own concerns; now surly, now gay; dependent on women, absent minded, moody, less and less able so he thought as he shaved to understand why Clarissa couldn't simply find them a lodging and be nice to Daisy; introduce her.
And then he could just just do what?
just haunt and hover he was at the moment actually engaged in sorting out various keys, papers , swoop and taste, be alone, in short, sufficient to himself
and yet nobody of course was more dependent upon others he buttoned his waistcoat
it had been his undoing.
He could not keep out of smoking rooms, liked colonels, liked golf, liked bridge, and above all women's society, and the fineness of their companionship, and their faithfulness and audacity and greatness in loving which though it had its drawbacks seemed to him and the dark, adorably pretty face was on top of the envelopes so wholly admirable, so splendid a flower to grow on the crest of human life, and yet he could not come up to the scratch, being always apt to see round things
Clarissa had sapped something in him permanently
and to tire very easily of mute devotion and to want variety in love, though it would make him furious if Daisy loved anybody else, furious!
for he was jealous, uncontrollably jealous by temperament.
He suffered tortures!
But where was his knife; his watch; his seals, his note case, and Clarissa's letter which he would not read again but liked to think of, and Daisy's photograph?
And now for dinner.
They were eating.
Sitting at little tables round vases, dressed or not dressed, with their shawls and bags laid beside them, with their air of false composure, for they were not used to so many courses at dinner, and confidence, for they were able to pay for it, and strain
for they had been running about London all day shopping, sightseeing
and their natural curiosity, for they looked round and up as the nice looking gentleman in horn rimmed spectacles came in
and their good nature, for they would have been glad to do any little service, such as lend a time table or impart useful information, and their desire, pulsing in them, tugging at them subterraneously, somehow to establish connections if it were only a birthplace Liverpool, for example in common or friends of the same name
with their furtive glances, odd silences, and sudden withdrawals into family jocularity and isolation
there they sat eating dinner when Mr. Walsh came in and took his seat at a little table by the curtain.
It was not that he said anything, for being solitary he could only address himself to the waiter
it was his way of looking at the menu, of pointing his forefinger to a particular wine, of hitching himself up to the table, of addressing himself seriously, not gluttonously to dinner, that won him their respect; which, having to remain unexpressed for the greater part of the meal, flared up at the table where the Morrises sat when Mr. Walsh was heard to say at the end of the meal, Bartlett pears.
Why he should have spoken so moderately yet firmly, with the air of a disciplinarian well within his rights which are founded upon justice, neither young Charles Morris, nor old Charles, neither Miss Elaine nor Mrs. Morris knew.
But when he said, Bartlett pears, sitting alone at his table, they felt that he counted on their support in some lawful demand; was champion of a cause which immediately became their own, so that their eyes met his eyes sympathetically, and when they all reached the smoking room simultaneously, a little talk between them became inevitable.
It was not very profound only to the effect that London was crowded
had changed in thirty years
that Mr. Morris preferred Liverpool
that Mrs. Morris had been to the Westminster flower show, and that they had all seen the Prince of Wales.
Yet, thought Peter Walsh, no family in the world can compare with the Morrises; none whatever; and their relations to each other are perfect, and they don't care a hang for the upper classes, and they like what they like, and Elaine is training for the family business, and the boy has won a scholarship at Leeds, and the old lady who is about his own age has three more children at home; and they have two motor cars, but Mr. Morris still mends the boots on Sunday
it is superb, it is absolutely superb, thought Peter Walsh, swaying a little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand among the hairy red chairs and ash trays
feeling very well pleased with himself, for the Morrises liked him.
Bartlett pears.
They liked him, he felt.
He would go to Clarissa's party.
The Morrises moved off
but they would meet again.
He would go to Clarissa's party, because he wanted to ask Richard what they were doing in India the conservative duffers.
And what's being acted?
And music....
Oh yes, and mere gossip.
For this is the truth about our soul, he thought, our self, who fish like inhabits deep seas and plies among obscurities threading her way between the boles of giant weeds, over sun flickered spaces and on and on into gloom, cold, deep, inscrutable
suddenly she shoots to the surface and sports on the wind wrinkled waves
that is, has a positive need to brush, scrape, kindle herself, gossiping.
What did the Government mean Richard Dalloway would know to do about India?
Since it was a very hot night and the paper boys went by with placards proclaiming in huge red letters that there was a heat wave, wicker chairs were placed on the hotel steps and there, sipping, smoking, detached gentlemen sat.
Peter Walsh sat there.
One might fancy that day, the London day, was just beginning.
Like a woman who had slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in blue and pearls, the day changed, put off stuff, took gauze, changed to evening, and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman breathes, tumbling petticoats on the floor, it too shed dust, heat, colour; the traffic thinned; motor cars, tinkling, darting, succeeded the lumber of vans
and here and there among the thick foliage of the squares an intense light hung.
I resign, the evening seemed to say, as it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences, moulded, pointed, of hotel, flat, and block of shops, I fade, she was beginning, I disappear, but London would have none of it, and rushed her bayonets into the sky, pinioned her, constrained her to partnership in her revelry.
For the great revolution of Mr. Willett's summer time had taken place since Peter Walsh's last visit to England.
The prolonged evening was new to him.
It was inspiriting, rather.
For as the young people went by with their despatch boxes, awfully glad to be free, proud too, dumbly, of stepping this famous pavement, joy of a kind, cheap, tinselly, if you like, but all the same rapture, flushed their faces.
They dressed well too; pink stockings; pretty shoes.
They would now have two hours at the pictures.
It sharpened, it refined them, the yellow blue evening light; and on the leaves in the square shone lurid, livid they looked as if dipped in sea water the foliage of a submerged city.
He was astonished by the beauty
it was encouraging too, for where the returned Anglo Indian sat by rights he knew crowds of them in the Oriental Club biliously summing up the ruin of the world, here was he, as young as ever
envying young people their summer time and the rest of it, and more than suspecting from the words of a girl, from a housemaid's laughter intangible things you couldn't lay your hands on that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable.
On top of them it had pressed; weighed them down, the women especially, like those flowers Clarissa's Aunt Helena used to press between sheets of grey blotting paper with Littre s dictionary on top, sitting under the lamp after dinner.
She was dead now.
He had heard of her, from Clarissa, losing the sight of one eye.
It seemed so fitting one of nature's masterpieces that old Miss Parry should turn to glass.
She would die like some bird in a frost gripping her perch.
She belonged to a different age, but being so entire, so complete, would always stand up on the horizon, stone white, eminent, like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous, long, long voyage, this interminable he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire he had held out that copper millions of times.
Surrey was all out once more
this interminable life.
But cricket was no mere game.
Cricket was important.
He could never help reading about cricket.
He read the scores in the stop press first, then how it was a hot day;
then about a murder case.
Having done things millions of times enriched them, though it might be said to take the surface off.
The past enriched, and experience, and having cared for one or two people, and so having acquired the power which the young lack, of cutting short, doing what one likes, not caring a rap what people say and coming and going without any very great expectations he left his paper on the table and moved off , which however and he looked for his hat and coat was not altogether true of him, not to night, for here he was starting to go to a party, at his age, with the belief upon him that he was about to have an experience.
But what?
Beauty anyhow.
Not the crude beauty of the eye.
It was not beauty pure and simple Bedford Place leading into Russell Square.
It was straightness and emptiness of course; the symmetry of a corridor; but it was also windows lit up, a piano, a gramophone sounding;
a sense of pleasure making hidden, but now and again emerging when, through the uncurtained window, the window left open, one saw parties sitting over tables, young people slowly circling, conversations between men and women, maids idly looking out a strange comment theirs, when work was done , stockings drying on top ledges, a parrot, a few plants.
Absorbing, mysterious, of infinite richness, this life.
And in the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick, there were loitering couples, dallying, embracing, shrunk up under the shower of a tree;
that was moving; so silent, so absorbed, that one passed, discreetly, timidly, as if in the presence of some sacred ceremony to interrupt which would have been impious.
That was interesting.
And so on into the flare and glare.
His light overcoat blew open, he stepped with indescribable idiosyncrasy, lent a little forward, tripped, with his hands behind his back and his eyes still a little hawklike; he tripped through London, towards Westminster, observing.
Was everybody dining out, then?
Doors were being opened here by a footman to let issue a high stepping old dame, in buckled shoes, with three purple ostrich feathers in her hair.
Doors were being opened for ladies wrapped like mummies in shawls with bright flowers on them, ladies with bare heads.
having run up to see the children
men waited for them, with their coats blowing open, and the motor started.
Everybody was going out.
What with these doors being opened, and the descent and the start, it seemed as if the whole of London were embarking in little boats moored to the bank, tossing on the waters, as if the whole place were floating off in carnival.
And Whitehall was skated over, silver beaten as it was, skated over by spiders, and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps
it was so hot that people stood about talking.
And here in Westminster was a retired Judge, presumably, sitting four square at his house door dressed all in white.
An Anglo Indian presumably.
And here a shindy of brawling women, drunken women; here only a policeman and looming houses, high houses, domed houses, churches, parliaments, and the hoot of a steamer on the river, a hollow misty cry.
But it was her street, this, Clarissa's; cabs were rushing round the corner, like water round the piers of a bridge, drawn together, it seemed to him because they bore people going to her party, Clarissa's party.
The cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye were a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls unrecorded.
The brain must wake now.
The body must contract now, entering the house, the lighted house, where the door stood open, where the motor cars were standing, and bright women descending: the soul must brave itself to endure.
He opened the big blade of his pocket knife.
Lucy came running full tilt downstairs, having just nipped in to the drawing room to smooth a cover, to straighten a chair, to pause a moment and feel whoever came in must think how clean, how bright, how beautifully cared for, when they saw the beautiful silver, the brass fire irons, the new chair covers, and the curtains of yellow chintz: she appraised each
heard a roar of voices
people already coming up from dinner; she must fly!
The Prime Minister was coming, Agnes said: so she had heard them say in the dining room, she said, coming in with a tray of glasses.
Did it matter, did it matter in the least, one Prime Minister more or less?
It made no difference at this hour of the night to Mrs. Walker among the plates, saucepans, cullenders, frying pans, chicken in aspic, ice cream freezers, pared crusts of bread, lemons, soup tureens, and pudding basins which, however hard they washed up in the scullery seemed to be all on top of her, on the kitchen table, on chairs, while the fire blared and roared, the electric lights glared, and still supper had to be laid.
All she felt was, one Prime Minister more or less made not a scrap of difference to Mrs. Walker.
The ladies were going upstairs already, said Lucy
the ladies were going up
the salmon was always underdone.
But some lady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said, Lucy said, about the entree, was it really made at home?
But it was the salmon that bothered Mrs. Walker, as she spun the plates round and round, and pulled in dampers and pulled out dampers; and there came a burst of laughter from the dining room; a voice speaking
then another burst of laughter
the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies had gone.
The tokay, said Lucy running in.
Mr. Dalloway had sent for the tokay, from the Emperor's cellars, the Imperial Tokay.
It was borne through the kitchen.
Over her shoulder Lucy reported how Miss Elizabeth looked quite lovely; she couldn't take her eyes off her; in her pink dress, wearing the necklace Mr. Dalloway had given her.
Jenny must remember the dog, Miss Elizabeth's fox terrier, which, since it bit, had to be shut up and might, Elizabeth thought, want something.
Jenny must remember the dog.
But Jenny was not going upstairs with all those people about.
There was a motor at the door already!
There was a ring at the bell
and the gentlemen still in the dining room
drinking tokay!
There, they were going upstairs; that was the first to come, and now they would come faster and faster, so that Mrs. Parkinson
hired for parties
would leave the hall door ajar, and the hall would be full of gentlemen waiting
they stood waiting, sleeking down their hair
while the ladies took their cloaks off in the room along the passage
where Mrs. Barnet helped them, old Ellen Barnet
Miss Alice didn't need rouge, said Mrs. Barnet, looking at her fondly.
The dear old body, said Lady Lovejoy, mounting the stairs, Clarissa's old nurse.
And then Lady Lovejoy stiffened.
Lady and Miss Lovejoy, she said to Mr. Wilkins hired for parties .
Sir John and Lady Needham...
Miss Weld...
Mr. Walsh.
His manner was admirable; his family life must be irreproachable, except that it seemed impossible that a being with greenish lips and shaven cheeks could ever have blundered into the nuisance of children.
How delightful to see you!
She was at her worst effusive, insincere.
It was a great mistake to have come.
He should have stayed at home and read his book, thought Peter Walsh; should have gone to a music hall; he should have stayed at home, for he knew no one.
Oh dear, it was going to be a failure; a complete failure, Clarissa felt it in her bones as dear old Lord Lexham stood there apologising for his wife who had caught cold at the Buckingham Palace garden party.
She could see Peter out of the tail of her eye, criticising her, there, in that corner.
Why, after all, did she do these things?
Why seek pinnacles and stand drenched in fire?
Might it consume her anyhow!
Burn her to cinders!
Better anything, better brandish one's torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away like some Ellie Henderson!
It was idiotic.
But why did he come, then, merely to criticise?
Why always take, never give?
Why not risk one's one little point of view?
There he was wandering off, and she must speak to him.
But she would not get the chance.
Life was that
humiliation, renunciation.
my dear, you ladies are all alike
It was delicious, how they petted each other, that old couple.
She did like old Lord Lexham.
She did think it mattered, her party, and it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong, all falling flat.
Anything, any explosion, any horror was better than people wandering aimlessly
standing in a bunch at a corner like Ellie Henderson, not even caring to hold themselves upright.
Gently the yellow curtain with all the birds of Paradise blew out and it seemed as if there were a flight of wings into the room, right out, then sucked back.
For the windows were open.
Was it draughty, Ellie Henderson wondered?
She was subject to chills.
But it did not matter that she should come down sneezing to morrow
it was the girls with their naked shoulders she thought of, being trained to think of others by an old father, an invalid, late vicar of Bourton, but he was dead now
and her chills never went to her chest, never.
It was the girls she thought of, the young girls with their bare shoulders, she herself having always been a wisp of a creature, with her thin hair and meagre profile
though now, past fifty, there was beginning to shine through some mild beam, something purified into distinction by years of self abnegation but obscured again, perpetually, by her distressing gentility, her panic fear, which arose from three hundred pounds' income
For her invitation to Clarissa's party had come at the last moment.
She was not quite happy about it.
She had a sort of feeling that Clarissa had not meant to ask her this year.
Why should she?
There was no reason really, except that they had always known each other.
Indeed, they were cousins.
But naturally they had rather drifted apart, Clarissa being so sought after.
It was an event to her, going to a party.
It was quite a treat just to see the lovely clothes.
Wasn't that Elizabeth, grown up, with her hair done in the fashionable way, in the pink dress?
Yet she could not be more than seventeen.
She was very, very handsome.
But girls when they first came out didn't seem to wear white as they used.
She must remember everything to tell Edith.
Girls wore straight frocks, perfectly tight, with skirts well above the ankles.
It was not becoming, she thought.
So, with her weak eyesight, Ellie Henderson craned rather forward, and it wasn't so much she who minded not having any one to talk to she hardly knew anybody there , for she felt that they were all such interesting people to watch
politicians presumably
Richard Dalloway's friends
but it was Richard himself who felt that he could not let the poor creature go on standing there all the evening by herself.
Ellie, and how's the world treating YOU?
Yes, they do,
said Richard Dalloway.
Yes.
But what more did one say?
He hadn't changed a bit.
And off they went together walking right across the room
giving each other little pats, as if they hadn't met for a long time, Ellie Henderson thought, watching them go, certain she knew that man's face.
A tall man, middle aged, rather fine eyes, dark, wearing spectacles
with a look of John Burrows.
Edith would be sure to know.
The curtain with its flight of birds of Paradise blew out again.
And Clarissa saw
she saw Ralph Lyon beat it back, and go on talking.
So it wasn't a failure after all!
it was going to be all right now her party.
It had begun.
It had started.
But it was still touch and go.
She must stand there for the present.
People seemed to come in a rush.
Colonel and Mrs. Garrod...
Mr. Hugh Whitbread...
Mr. Bowley...
Mrs. Hilbery...
Lady Mary Maddox...
Mr. Quin...
She had six or seven words with each, and they went on, they went into the rooms; into something now, not nothing, since Ralph Lyon had beat back the curtain.
And yet for her own part, it was too much of an effort.
She was not enjoying it.
It was too much like being just anybody, standing there
anybody could do it
yet this anybody she did a little admire, couldn't help feeling that she had, anyhow, made this happen, that it marked a stage, this post that she felt herself to have become, for oddly enough she had quite forgotten what she looked like, but felt herself a stake driven in at the top of her stairs.
Every time she gave a party she had this feeling of being something not herself, and that every one was unreal in one way
much more real in another.
It was, she thought, partly their clothes, partly being taken out of their ordinary ways, partly the background, it was possible to say things you couldn't say anyhow else, things that needed an effort; possible to go much deeper.
But not for her; not yet anyhow.
How delightful to see you!
Dear old Sir Harry!
He would know every one.
And what was so odd about it was the sense one had as they came up the stairs one after another, Mrs. Mount and Celia, Herbert Ainsty, Mrs. Dakers oh and Lady Bruton!
How awfully good of you to come!
WHAT name?
Lady Rosseter?
But who on earth was Lady Rosseter?
That voice!
It was Sally Seton!
Sally Seton!
after all these years!
She loomed through a mist.
Not like that!
All on top of each other, embarrassed, laughing, words tumbled out passing through London
heard from Clara Haydon
what a chance of seeing you!
So I thrust myself in without an invitation....
One might put down the hot water can quite composedly.
The lustre had gone out of her.
Yet it was extraordinary to see her again, older, happier, less lovely.
They kissed each other, first this cheek then that, by the drawing room door, and Clarissa turned, with Sally's hand in hers, and saw her rooms full, heard the roar of voices, saw the candlesticks, the blowing curtains, and the roses which Richard had given her.
I have five enormous boys,
said Sally.
She had the simplest egotism, the most open desire to be thought first always, and Clarissa loved her for being still like that.
I can't believe it!
But alas, Wilkins; Wilkins wanted her
Wilkins was emitting in a voice of commanding authority as if the whole company must be admonished and the hostess reclaimed from frivolity, one name:
The Prime Minister
said Peter Walsh.
The Prime Minister?
Was it really? Ellie Henderson marvelled.
What a thing to tell Edith!
One couldn't laugh at him.
He looked so ordinary.
You might have stood him behind a counter and bought biscuits
poor chap, all rigged up in gold lace.
And to be fair, as he went his rounds, first with Clarissa then with Richard escorting him, he did it very well.
He tried to look somebody.
It was amusing to watch.
Nobody looked at him.
They just went on talking, yet it was perfectly plain that they all knew, felt to the marrow of their bones, this majesty passing; this symbol of what they all stood for, English society.
Old Lady Bruton, and she looked very fine too, very stalwart in her lace, swam up, and they withdrew into a little room which at once became spied upon, guarded, and a sort of stir and rustle rippled through every one, openly
the Prime Minister!
Lord, lord, the snobbery of the English! thought Peter Walsh, standing in the corner.
That must be, by Jove it was, Hugh Whitbread, snuffing round the precincts of the great, grown rather fatter, rather whiter, the admirable Hugh!
He looked always as if he were on duty, thought Peter, a privileged, but secretive being, hoarding secrets which he would die to defend, though it was only some little piece of tittle tattle dropped by a court footman, which would be in all the papers tomorrow.
Such were his rattles, his baubles, in playing with which he had grown white, come to the verge of old age, enjoying the respect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this type of the English public school man.
Inevitably one made up things like that about Hugh
that was his style
the style of those admirable letters which Peter had read thousands of miles across the sea in the Times, and had thanked God he was out of that pernicious hubble bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and coolies beat their wives.
An olive skinned youth from one of the Universities stood obsequiously by.
Him he would patronise, initiate, teach how to get on.
For he liked nothing better than doing kindnesses, making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of being thought of in their age, their affliction, thinking themselves quite forgotten, yet here was dear Hugh driving up
spending an hour talking of the past, remembering trifles, praising the home made cake, though Hugh might eat cake with a Duchess any day of his life, and, to look at him, probably did spend a good deal of time in that agreeable occupation.
The All judging, the All merciful, might excuse.
Peter Walsh had no mercy.
Villains there must be, and God knows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl out in a train do less harm on the whole than Hugh Whitbread and his kindness.
Look at him now, on tiptoe, dancing forward, bowing and scraping, as the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton emerged, intimating for all the world to see that he was privileged to say something, something private, to Lady Bruton as she passed.
She wagged her fine old head.
She was thanking him presumably for some piece of servility.
She had her toadies, minor officials in Government offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her behalf, in return for which she gave them luncheon.
But she derived from the eighteenth century.
She was all right.
And now Clarissa escorted her Prime Minister down the room
prancing, sparkling, with the stateliness of her grey hair.
She wore ear rings, and a silver green mermaid's dress.
Lolloping on the waves and braiding her tresses she seemed, having that gift still; to be; to exist;
to sum it all up in the moment as she passed; turned, caught her scarf in some other woman's dress, unhitched it, laughed, all with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element.
But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves.
There was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her woodenness were all warmed through now, and she had about her as she said good bye to the thick gold laced man who was doing his best, and good luck to him, to look important, an inexpressible dignity; an exquisite cordiality
as if she wished the whole world well, and must now, being on the very verge and rim of things, take her leave.
So she made him think.
But he was not in love.
Indeed, Clarissa felt, the Prime Minister had been good to come.
And, walking down the room with him.
That was satisfying; that was real.
Ah, how she hated her hot, hypocritical, corrupt; with all that power; Elizabeth's seducer;
the woman who had crept in to steal and defile
Richard would say, What nonsense! .
She hated her: she loved her.
It was enemies one wanted, not friends not Mrs. Durrant and Clara, Sir William and Lady Bradshaw, Miss Truelock and Eleanor Gibson
whom she saw coming upstairs .
They must find her if they wanted her.
She was for the party!
There was her old friend Sir Harry.
Dear Sir Harry!
For Willie Titcomb and Sir Harry and Herbert Ainsty were all laughing.
He chaffed her about her party.
He missed his brandy.
These circles, he said, were above him.
But he liked her
respected her, in spite of her damnable, difficult upper class refinement, which made it impossible to ask Clarissa Dalloway to sit on his knee.
They won't tell us their stories,
said Clarissa.
Dear Clarissa!
And really Clarissa's eyes filled with tears.
Her mother, walking in a garden!
But alas, she must go.
For there was Professor Brierly, who lectured on Milton, talking to little Jim Hutton who was unable even for a party like this to compass both tie and waistcoat or make his hair lie flat , and even at this distance they were quarrelling, she could see.
For Professor Brierly was a very queer fish.
With all those degrees, honours, lectureships between him and the scribblers he suspected instantly an atmosphere not favourable to his queer compound
his prodigious learning and timidity
his wintry charm without cordiality
his innocence blent with snobbery;
he quivered if made conscious by a lady's unkempt hair, a youth's boots, of an underworld, very creditable doubtless, of rebels, of ardent young people; of would be geniuses
and intimated with a little toss of the head, with a sniff Humph!
the value of moderation
of some slight training in the classics in order to appreciate Milton.
Professor Brierly Clarissa could see wasn't hitting it off with little Jim Hutton who wore red socks, his black being at the laundry about Milton.
She interrupted.
She said she loved Bach.
So did Hutton.
That was the bond between them, and Hutton a very bad poet always felt that Mrs. Dalloway was far the best of the great ladies who took an interest in art.
It was odd how strict she was.
About music she was purely impersonal.
She was rather a prig.
But how charming to look at!
She made her house so nice if it weren't for her Professors.
Clarissa had half a mind to snatch him off and set him down at the piano in the back room.
For he played divinely.
But the noise!
The noise!
The sign of a successful party.
Nodding urbanely, the Professor stepped delicately off.
He knows everything in the whole world about Milton,
Does he indeed?
But she must speak to that couple, said Clarissa, Lord Gayton and Nancy Blow.
Not that THEY added perceptibly to the noise of the party.
They were not talking perceptibly as they stood side by side by the yellow curtains.
They would soon be off elsewhere, together
and never had very much to say in any circumstances.
They looked
that was all.
That was enough.
They looked so clean, so sound, she with an apricot bloom of powder and paint, but he scrubbed, rinsed, with the eyes of a bird, so that no ball could pass him or stroke surprise him.
He struck, he leapt, accurately, on the spot.
Ponies' mouths quivered at the end of his reins.
He had his honours
ancestral monuments, banners hanging in the church at home.
He had his duties; his tenants; a mother and sisters; had been all day at Lords, and that was what they were talking about cricket, cousins, the movies when Mrs. Dalloway came up.
Lord Gayton liked her most awfully.
So did Miss Blow.
She had such charming manners.
It is angelic
it is delicious of you to have come!
She loved Lords
she loved youth, and Nancy
dressed at enormous expense by the greatest artists in Paris, stood there looking as if her body had merely put forth, of its own accord, a green frill.
I had meant to have dancing,
For the young people could not talk.
And why should they?
Shout, embrace, swing, be up at dawn
carry sugar to ponies
kiss and caress the snouts of adorable chows
and then all tingling and streaming, plunge and swim.
But the enormous resources of the English language, the power it bestows, after all, of communicating feelings at their age, she and Peter would have been arguing all the evening , was not for them.
They would solidify young.
They would be good beyond measure to the people on the estate, but alone, perhaps, rather dull.
What a pity!
I had hoped to have dancing.
It was so extraordinarily nice of them to have come!
But talk of dancing!
The rooms were packed.
There was old Aunt Helena in her shawl.
Alas, she must leave them
Lord Gayton and Nancy Blow.
There was old Miss Parry, her aunt.
For Miss Helena Parry was not dead
Miss Parry was alive.
She was past eighty.
She ascended staircases slowly with a stick.
Richard had seen to it .
Where had Peter got to?
They used to be such friends.
For at the mention of India, or even Ceylon, her eyes only one was glass slowly deepened, became blue, beheld, not human beings
she had no tender memories, no proud illusions about Viceroys, Generals, Mutinies
it was orchids she saw, and mountain passes and herself carried on the backs of coolies in the sixties over solitary peaks
or descending to uproot orchids startling blossoms, never beheld before which she painted in water colour
an indomitable Englishwoman, fretful if disturbed by the War, say, which dropped a bomb at her very door, from her deep meditation over orchids and her own figure journeying in the sixties in India
but here was Peter.
Come and talk to Aunt Helena about Burma,
And yet he had not had a word with her all the evening!
leading him up to Aunt Helena, in her white shawl, with her stick.
We will talk later,
said Clarissa
Peter Walsh,
That meant nothing.
Clarissa had asked her.
It was tiring
it was noisy
but Clarissa had asked her.
So she had come.
It was a pity that they lived in London
Richard and Clarissa.
If only for Clarissa's health it would have been better to live in the country.
But Clarissa had always been fond of society.
He has been in Burma,
Ah.
She could not resist recalling what Charles Darwin had said about her little book on the orchids of Burma.
Clarissa must speak to Lady Bruton.
No doubt it was forgotten now, her book on the orchids of Burma, but it went into three editions before 1870, she told Peter.
She remembered him now.
He had been at Bourton
and he had left her, Peter Walsh remembered, without a word in the drawing room that night when Clarissa had asked him to come boating .
Richard so much enjoyed his lunch party,
said Clarissa to Lady Bruton.
Richard was the greatest possible help,
He helped me to write a letter.
And how are you?
Lady Bruton replied.
Lady Bruton detested illness in the wives of politicians.
Oh, perfectly well!
said Clarissa.
for she could never think of anything to say to Clarissa
though she liked her.
And there's Peter Walsh!
said Lady Bruton
She had lots of fine qualities; but they had nothing in common she and Clarissa.
It might have been better if Richard had married a woman with less charm, who would have helped him more in his work.
He had lost his chance of the Cabinet .
There's Peter Walsh!
she said
shaking hands with that agreeable sinner, that very able fellow who should have made a name for himself but hadn't always in difficulties with women , and, of course, old Miss Parry.
Wonderful old lady!
Lady Bruton stood by Miss Parry's chair, a spectral grenadier, draped in black, inviting Peter Walsh to lunch;
cordial but without small talk, remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of India.
She had been there, of course
had stayed with three Viceroys
thought some of the Indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows
but what a tragedy it was
the state of India!
The Prime Minister had just been telling her old Miss Parry huddled up in her shawl, did not care what the Prime Minister had just been telling her , and Lady Bruton would like to have Peter Walsh's opinion, he being fresh from the centre, and she would get Sir Sampson to meet him, for really it prevented her from sleeping at night, the folly of it, the wickedness she might say, being a soldier's daughter.
She was an old woman now, not good for much.
But her house, her servants, her good friend Milly Brush
did he remember her?
were all there only asking to be used if
if they could be of help, in short.
For she never spoke of England, but this isle of men, this dear, dear land, was in her blood without reading Shakespeare , and if ever a woman could have worn the helmet and shot the arrow, could have led troops to attack, ruled with indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield noseless in a church, or made a green grass mound on some primeval hillside, that woman was Millicent Bruton.
Debarred by her sex and some truancy, too, of the logical faculty she found it impossible to write a letter to the Times , she had the thought of Empire always at hand, and had acquired from her association with that armoured goddess her ramrod bearing, her robustness of demeanour, so that one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or roaming territories over which, in some spiritual shape, the Union Jack had ceased to fly.
To be not English even among the dead no, no!
Impossible!
But was it Lady Bruton whom she used to know ?
Was it Peter Walsh grown grey?
Lady Rosseter asked herself who had been Sally Seton .
It was old Miss Parry certainly the old aunt who used to be so cross when she stayed at Bourton.
Never should she forget running along the passage naked, and being sent for by Miss Parry!
And Clarissa!
oh Clarissa!
Sally caught her by the arm.
Clarissa stopped beside them.
But I can't stay,
I shall come later.
Wait,
she said, looking at Peter and Sally.
They must wait, she meant
all these people had gone.
she said, looking at her old friends, Sally and Peter, who were shaking hands, and Sally, remembering the past no doubt, was laughing.
I shall come back,
But her voice was wrung of its old ravishing richness; her eyes not aglow as they used to be, when she smoked cigars, when she ran down the passage to fetch her sponge bag, without a stitch of clothing on her, and Ellen Atkins asked, What if the gentlemen had met her?
But everybody forgave her.
She stole a chicken from the larder because she was hungry in the night
she smoked cigars in her bedroom
she left a priceless book in the punt.
But everybody adored her except perhaps Papa .
It was her warmth
her vitality she would paint, she would write.
Old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright.
and there he was, her old friend Hugh, talking to the Portuguese Ambassador
And Clarissa remembered having to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers which she was capable of doing with her daring, her recklessness, her melodramatic love of being the centre of everything and creating scenes, and it was bound, Clarissa used to think, to end in some awful tragedy; her death; her martyrdom
instead of which she had married, quite unexpectedly, a bald man with a large buttonhole who owned, it was said, cotton mills at Manchester.
And she had five boys!
She and Peter had settled down together.
They were talking
it seemed so familiar that they should be talking.
They would discuss the past.
With the two of them more even than with Richard she shared her past; the garden; the trees
old Joseph Breitkopf singing Brahms without any voice; the drawing room wallpaper; the smell of the mats.
A part of this Sally must always be; Peter must always be.
But she must leave them.
There were the Bradshaws, whom she disliked.
She must go up to Lady Bradshaw in grey and silver, balancing like a sea lion at the edge of its tank, barking for invitations, Duchesses, the typical successful man's wife , she must go up to Lady Bradshaw and say...
But Lady Bradshaw anticipated her.
We are shockingly late, dear Mrs. Dalloway, we hardly dared to come in,
And Sir William, who looked very distinguished, with his grey hair and blue eyes, said yes; they had not been able to resist the temptation.
He was talking to Richard about that Bill probably, which they wanted to get through the Commons.
Why did the sight of him, talking to Richard, curl her up?
He looked what he was, a great doctor.
A man absolutely at the head of his profession, very powerful, rather worn.
For think what cases came before him people in the uttermost depths of misery; people on the verge of insanity; husbands and wives.
He had to decide questions of appalling difficulty.
Yet what she felt was, one wouldn't like Sir William to see one unhappy.
No; not that man.
How is your son at Eton?
she asked Lady Bradshaw.
He had just missed his eleven, said Lady Bradshaw, because of the mumps.
Clarissa looked at Sir William, talking to Richard.
He did not look like a boy
not in the least like a boy.
She had once gone with some one to ask his advice.
He had been perfectly right; extremely sensible.
But Heavens
what a relief to get out to the street again!
There was some poor wretch sobbing, she remembered, in the waiting room.
But she did not know what it was
about Sir William; what exactly she disliked.
Only Richard agreed with her
But he was extraordinarily able.
They were talking about this Bill.
Some case, Sir William was mentioning, lowering his voice.
It had its bearing upon what he was saying about the deferred effects of shell shock.
There must be some provision in the Bill.
a very sad case.
She went on, into the little room where the Prime Minister had gone with Lady Bruton.
Perhaps there was somebody there.
But there was nobody.
The chairs still kept the impress of the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton, she turned deferentially, he sitting four square, authoritatively.
They had been talking about India.
There was nobody.
The party's splendour fell to the floor, so strange it was to come in alone in her finery.
What business had the Bradshaws to talk of death at her party?
A young man had killed himself.
And they talked of it at her party
the Bradshaws, talked of death.
He had killed himself but how?
Always her body went through it first, when she was told, suddenly, of an accident
her dress flamed, her body burnt.
He had thrown himself from a window.
Up had flashed the ground
through him, blundering, bruising, went the rusty spikes.
There he lay with a thud, thud, thud in his brain, and then a suffocation of blackness.
So she saw it.
But why had he done it?
And the Bradshaws talked of it at her party!
She had once thrown a shilling into the Serpentine, never anything more.
But he had flung it away.
They went on living
she would have to go back;
the rooms were still crowded;
people kept on coming
They all day she had been thinking of Bourton, of Peter, of Sally , they would grow old.
A thing there was that mattered
a thing, wreathed about with chatter, defaced, obscured in her own life, let drop every day in corruption, lies, chatter.
This he had preserved.
Death was defiance.
Death was an attempt to communicate
people feeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which, mystically, evaded them
closeness drew apart
rapture faded, one was alone.
There was an embrace in death.
But this young man who had killed himself
had he plunged holding his treasure?
Suppose he had had that passion
Then she had felt it only this morning there was the terror
the overwhelming incapacity, one's parents giving it into one's hands, this life, to be lived to the end, to be walked with serenely
there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear.
Even now, quite often if Richard had not been there reading the Times, so that she could crouch like a bird and gradually revive, send roaring up that immeasurable delight, rubbing stick to stick, one thing with another, she must have perished.
But that young man had killed himself.
Somehow it was her disaster her disgrace.
It was her punishment to see sink and disappear here a man, there a woman, in this profound darkness, and she forced to stand here in her evening dress.
She had schemed
she had pilfered.
She was never wholly admirable.
She had wanted success.
Lady Bexborough and the rest of it.
And once she had walked on the terrace at Bourton.
It was due to Richard; she had never been so happy.
Nothing could be slow enough; nothing last too long.
No pleasure could equal, she thought, straightening the chairs, pushing in one book on the shelf, this having done with the triumphs of youth, lost herself in the process of living, to find it, with a shock of delight, as the sun rose, as the day sank.
Many a time had she gone, at Bourton when they were all talking, to look at the sky
or seen it between people's shoulders at dinner; seen it in London when she could not sleep.
She walked to the window.
It held, foolish as the idea was, something of her own in it, this country sky, this sky above Westminster.
She parted the curtains
she looked.
Oh, but how surprising!
in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her!
She was going to bed.
And the sky.
It will be a solemn sky, she had thought, it will be a dusky sky, turning away its cheek in beauty.
But there it was ashen pale, raced over quickly by tapering vast clouds.
It was new to her.
The wind must have risen.
She was going to bed, in the room opposite.
It was fascinating to watch her, moving about, that old lady, crossing the room, coming to the window.
Could she see her?
It was fascinating, with people still laughing and shouting in the drawing room, to watch that old woman, quite quietly, going to bed.
She pulled the blind now.
The clock began striking.
The young man had killed himself; but she did not pity him; with the clock striking the hour, one, two, three, she did not pity him, with all this going on.
the old lady had put out her light!
the whole house was dark now with this going on, she repeated, and the words came to her, Fear no more the heat of the sun.
She must go back to them.
But what an extraordinary night!
She felt somehow very like him
the young man who had killed himself.
She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away.
The clock was striking.
The leaden circles dissolved in the air.
But she must go back.
She must assemble.
She must find Sally and Peter.
And she came in from the little room.
But where is Clarissa?
said Peter.
He was sitting on the sofa with Sally.
Where's the woman gone to?
Where's Clarissa?
Sally supposed, and so did Peter for the matter of that, that there were people of importance, politicians, whom neither of them knew unless by sight in the picture papers, whom Clarissa had to be nice to, had to talk to.
She was with them.
Yet there was Richard Dalloway not in the Cabinet.
He hadn't been a success, Sally supposed?
For herself, she scarcely ever read the papers.
She sometimes saw his name mentioned.
But then well, she lived a very solitary life, in the wilds, Clarissa would say, among great merchants, great manufacturers, men, after all, who did things.
She had done things too!
I have five sons!
she told him.
Lord, Lord, what a change had come over her!
the softness of motherhood; its egotism too.
But these two, Sally whispered, these two coming now and really she must go, if Clarissa did not come soon , this distinguished looking man and his rather common looking wife who had been talking to Richard
what could one know about people like that?
That they're damnable humbugs, said Peter, looking at them casually.
He made Sally laugh.
But Sir William Bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture.
He looked in the corner for the engraver's name.
His wife looked too.
Sir William Bradshaw was so interested in art.
When one was young, said Peter, one was too much excited to know people.
Now that one was old, fifty two to be precise Sally was fifty five, in body, she said, but her heart was like a girl's of twenty
now that one was mature then, said Peter, one could watch, one could understand, and one did not lose the power of feeling, he said.
No, that is true, said Sally.
She felt more deeply, more passionately, every year.
It increased, he said, alas, perhaps, but one should be glad of it
it went on increasing in his experience.
There was some one in India.
He would like to tell Sally about her.
He would like Sally to know her.
She was married, he said.
She had two small children.
They must all come to Manchester, said Sally
he must promise before they left.
There's Elizabeth, he said, she feels not half what we feel
not yet.
But, said Sally, watching Elizabeth go to her father, one can see they are devoted to each other.
She could feel it by the way Elizabeth went to her father.
For her father had been looking at her, as he stood talking to the Bradshaws, and he had thought to himself, Who is that lovely girl?
And suddenly he realised that it was his Elizabeth, and he had not recognised her, she looked so lovely in her pink frock!
Elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to Willie Titcomb.
So she went to him and they stood together, now that the party was almost over, looking at the people going, and the rooms getting emptier and emptier, with things scattered on the floor.
Even Ellie Henderson was going, nearly last of all
though no one had spoken to her, but she had wanted to see everything, to tell Edith.
And Richard and Elizabeth were rather glad it was over, but Richard was proud of his daughter.
And he had not meant to tell her, but he could not help telling her.
He had looked at her, he said, and he had wondered
Who is that lovely girl?
and it was his daughter!
That did make her happy.
But her poor dog was howling.
Richard has improved.
You are right, said Sally.
I shall go and talk to him.
I shall say goodnight.
What does the brain matter, said Lady Rosseter, getting up, compared with the heart?
I will come, said Peter
but he sat on for a moment.
What is this terror?
what is this ecstasy?
What is it that fills me with extraordinary excitement?
It is Clarissa, he said.
